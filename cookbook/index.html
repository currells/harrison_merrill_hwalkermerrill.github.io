        <h2>How this works</h2>
        <!-- <h3>
          <i>&nbsp;“Pain? Pain is a mother's kiss. A soft embrace offered by life to remind you that your heart still beats. Death denied me pain, and left only hollow, aching misery pressing in from all sides. An arm plunged into a glacial river—numb, distant, alien—not even a shiver to warm a hollow chest. Eight centuries I persisted without purpose, pain, or sweet oblivion—a trophy for a rapist king, gifted by mewling cowards. And at the center of it all, the bastard lich himself: proud and preening when he cast me down. Where was that pride when he fled like a beaten dog into the darkest womb of the earth?</i>
          <br><i>&nbsp;“But now he hopes again. I can hear his hope in my chest like I once heard my own blood drain away, spattering on cold stone. And knowing I can take that from him—it stings like sweet, soft pain again.”</i>
          <br> — Arazni, the Red Queen of Geb, Fallen Herald of the Last Azlanti

        <h2>Dietary Restrictions</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Click to Show/Hide information about Dietary Restrictions:</b>
          <li style="display: none;"><b>Allergies:</b> Our family deals with allergies to milk, eggs, and peanuts, and as such, all recipes found here are made with alternatives, when possible. If the recipe contains any of those ingredients, its because replacing them hasn't been determined to be worth it.</li>
          <li style="display: none;"><b>Secret Ingredients:</b> These sections are special changes to standard recipes that we do, and are often worth the effort. However, the meal will turn out just fine if you skip these ingredients and they're associated steps.</li>
          <li style="display: none;"><b>Spices:</b> Our family likes a tasty heat - not too hot to enjoy, not bland or bad tasting. If our recipe is too hot for you, feel free to leave out the hotter, usually marked as optional, ingredients.</li>
