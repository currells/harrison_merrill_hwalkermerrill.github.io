        <h2>How this works</h2>
        <h3><i>“There is no need for suffering. Pain and sorrow are merely the symptoms of life. And what is life but a disease whose only cure is death? How many times have you heard the ill wailing in agony over festering sores that won’t heal, or watched a child stand crying at his parents’ grave, or passed an old woman in rags reaching out a bony hand for a bit of bread to sustain her a little longer? I have seen these things time and time again. Existence need not be so crude. It can be far more dignified, far more peaceful. Won’t you let me show you the relief we can offer the world?”</i> <br> — Dr. Lavinia Penrose, physician and Whispering Way practitioner</h3>

        <h2>Where We Are Now: ???</h2>
        <p>Currently, lost and stranded, everyone is just trying to stay alive.</p>
        <!--<h2>Where We Are Now: Rosler's Coffer</h2>
        <p>Named for Ervin Roslar, a hero of the Shining Crusade, the town has survived over 800 years despite sharing a frontier with the orcs of Belkzen, even trading peacefully with several tribes who seasonally wander nearby. Lastwall considers the town, which helps establish the local borders and grows much of the flax used in Vigil, important enough to maintain a small garrison of knights there. While its existence has been challenging, Roslar’s Coffer persisted largely without issue for centuries until the more violent Twisted Nail tribe pushed the less aggressive orc tribes out of the region and began launching raids against outlying farms. These attacks eventually escalated until the Twisted Nails assaulted Roslar’s Coffer itself in 4707 ar, burning its historic buildings, wiping out over a quarter of the population, and scattering the remaining residents. About half the survivors returned the next season to rebuild, only to discover a territorial creature called a red reaver had moved into the Sarenite monastery a mile outside of town, forcing the church to relocate into the newly rebuilt town itself.</p>
        <p>Lastwall deployed additional knights to patrol the border regions as Roslar’s Coffer rebuilt. These warriors turned back several new raids by the Twisted Nail, who eventually turned their frustrations inward toward Belkzen. None of the knights’ efforts managed to dislodge the red reaver from its new lair, however. It continued to plunder nearby farms and assault travelers, and locals quickly learned to simply avoid the grounds and orchards once managed by the church and otherwise went on with their lives. Agents of the prestigious Pathfinder Society arrived last year to investigate the temple, and after a daring battle, finally felled the beast! The church of Sarenrae has made only brief surveys of the damage caused by the monster in its 10-year stay, and they still operate from town. This sudden burst of excitement nonetheless inspired many of the town’s youth to spin fantasies about becoming adventurers and Pathfinders themselves.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Sarenite temple, Roslar’s Coffer enjoys minor fame for Roslar’s Tomb, a sizable crypt in the town cemetery that houses the earthly remains of several heroes from the Shining Crusade (although, ironically, not Roslar himself, after rumors of a scandal arose upon his death). Faithful of both Iomedae and Gorum occasionally visit on pilgrimage to pay their respects to these fallen heroes of the past, and the town is all too happy to provide accommodations in exchange for newcomers’ coin. Thanks to its location along the Tourondel River, the town also sees some traffic in the form of crusaders, messengers, pilgrims, and traders from both Lastwall and Nirmathas.</p>-->

        <h2>Lastwall At A Glance</h2>
        <p>Lastwall is a land of rolling grasslands, primeval forests, and ancient battle scars. Once a landscape of orc holds and Kellid city-states dotted with Taldan supply forts, the Whispering Tyrant began to steadily consume the territory after 3200 ar. Orc and Kellid populations were pressed or enslaved into service, with those who fell—either in battle of ill-fated rebellions— animated to serve mindlessly until their bones crumbled to dust. Tar-Baphon’s forces razed entire cities and monuments, leaving only buried foundations that now litter the landscape as dungeons and makeshift crypts. By the time Taldor mobilized against the Whispering Tyrant 5 centuries later, generations of gloom and toil had rendered the landscape fallow and hopeless. War left new wounds upon the land. Strongholds and cities built to honor the Whispering Tyrant were torn down to the flagstones and used as the building blocks for new fortifications against the wizard-king. Mass battles left landscapes impregnated with shattered bone and bent steel, with many stretches of land still fetid and unable to support crops. Terrible magic and spirits still haunt many ancient battlefields, even a millennium later.</p>
        <p>Despite the horror it has seen, those portions of Lastwall held by mortal hands are beautiful and bountiful. Proximity to Lake Encarthan provides ample rainfall and cool summers, albeit harsh and snowy winters. Growing seasons are long enough to support a variety of crops. The Northern Fangwood Forest and foothills of the Hungry Mountains effectively divide Lastwall in half. Eastern Lastwall is far more urban and reclaimed, with vast farms and ranches supporting cattle and the nation’s famous horses, as well as the trade city of Vellumis—an ancient Ustalavic port and the largest city in the nation. Western Lastwall is less tamed and more hostile—an irony, given that the nation’s capital of Vigil lies in this untamed half—with frequent incursions from Belkzen orcs, occasional resurgences of necromantic energy, and large tracts of land and forest left largely unexplored and untouched by modern hands. Roslar’s Coffer—western Lastwall’s southernmost town—exists largely by the grace of the Tourondel River, and little in the way of modern construction exists between it and the fortresses over 100 miles north except a well-guarded stone road and a few hunting lodges. Despite this isolation, the people of Roslar’s Coffer squarely consider themselves residents of Lastwall and do what they can to contribute to the nation.</p>
        <p>With a strong-hearted and faithful military tradition, the people of Lastwall tend to be community-focused, forthright, and hard working. Their survival depends on trusting each person in the community to do their job to the best of her ability, and every citizen knows his community could fall to the next orc raid or harsh winter if he doesn’t give every task his best effort. As a people squeezed between two hostile presences, they are deeply devout, with most residents attending temple services multiple times a week, but as with all things, practicality comes first, and worship must wait if there is work to be done. Most citizens spend the spring planting, summers drilling with weapons and armor, and the autumn harvesting before the first hard freeze. The long, cold winters are a time of respite—orcs rarely campaign in the snow, and freezing temperatures harden the ground and prevent the restless dead from wandering—allowing more attention to hobbies, family, and friends. Feasts and marriages are common in the winter months, though most are generally small, local affairs, as roads during the Lastwall winter can be punishing even for seasoned travelers.</p>
