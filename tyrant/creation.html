    <h3>“In war or peace, information is all. Without aware ears and eyes, who would even know when peace turns to war? An assassin in your employ is a liability if he is fooled into killing the wrong target. The mightiest arcanist or witch is next to helpless if she believes her foe to be her dearest friend. Everyone miscalculates at times. Everyone has weaknesses. Know the information that keeps your allies happy and useful. Give it to them. Know the information that would displease them or turn them against you. Eliminate it. Silence those who would reveal it or learn even more dangerous secrets about them.”<br> — Iranez of the Orb, Arclord of Nex</h3>

      <h2>Step 1: Choose a Class</h2>
      <h3>Get an idead for the kind of character you want to play. Magic or Melee? Tactical or Straigtforward? Highly Skilled or Powerful? Team Oriented or Loner? Choosing a class is the first step in building your character.</h3>
      <p>There are no restrictions on classes, though the Players Guide has some advice. Classes that rely on a certain degree of stable infrastructure, especially urban-focused classes and archetypes, may have a harder time. Characters with some ability to navigate effectively or have the ability to travel faster will find pratical applications for their skills frequently.</p>
      <p>Given their prevelence in Lastwall, paladins are an obvious choice, as are clerics and warpriests, but players of such characters shuold do so with an open mind, as many important growth moments in the Adventure Path require working alongside the lesser of two evils for the betterment of the world. It's worth pointing out that even the paladin code allows lawful good characters to work alongside evil companions for the greater good, so long as they can curb the dark actions of their allies.</p>
      <p>Other classes well suited for Tyrants Grasp include fighters, rangers, rogues, and qizards. Druids - residents of the nearby Fangwood Forest - are likewise a local feature, though druid players may find the desolate landscapes limiting. Because of the numerous undead opponents, bards (as well as enchanters and illusionists) may find fewer targets for their magic and songs. Characters reliants on using very specific equipment will struggle due to the scarcity of resources and shopping opportunities, particularly in the begining.</p>
      <p>Monks, cavaliers, and inquisitors are represented well in Lastwall, and even summoners and witches are left in peace so long as their gifts aren;t turned toward destruction or control. Brawlers, hunters, investigatos, and slayers are also among the nation's heroes, as well as spiritualists and mediums who handle the omnipresent lingering restless spirits.</p>
      <p>Classes of a chaotic bent - barbarians and skalds especially - are not undeard of, but are not well represented amond the notably honor-bound culture of Lastwall and may have a hard time finding kindred spirits or welcoming aid.</p>
      <p>Finally, a caution is given to characters reliant on animal companions, cohorts, familiars, or mounts, with the exception of the witch and the shaman, as those creatures will be seperated from the player near the begining of the adventure, though their aid and companionship may prove invaluable throughout the campaign once reunited (or replaced).</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Rolling Stats</h2>
      <h3>Stat rolls must be done in person with the GM, so they will not be detailed heavily here. Depending on stats, the chosen character concept and class may need to be tweaked. If the stats rolled are not to the players liking, they may choose to default to a 20-point buy.</h3>

      <h2>Step 4: Finalization</h2>
      <h3>Please audit your character to make sure nothing has been forgotten. It may be wise to check your character sheet with the GM. Also, check with your GM if anything is confusing, if you need help with any of these steps, or if you are concerend about how something in your character build may interact with the campaign world or the party.</h3>
      <p>Your characters personality and familial details will also be important and need to be determined before the comencement of the capaign. Work with your GM to plan these, but understand that most characters will probably need: Likes, Dislikes, Fears, Aspirations, Parents, Parental Relationship, and Close Relationship Details such as information regarding a current or former spouse, sibling, or child.</p>
      <p>Double check your character, and make sure you know how your character fits in the community (whether or not they already know the other players). Whether they were raised here, are temporarily stationed here, came here to set up shop or find work, or thought hey were just passing through, your character should have been living in Rosler's Coffer (the starting location of the game) for at least the last year, and preferably at least the last ten years.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">Some commonly overlooked items are:</b>
        <li>Calculating skill bonus totals, base attack bonuses, total health, saving throws, and combat modifiers.</li>
        <li>Choosing Spells Known and Spells Prepped.</li>
        <li>Determining your characters height, weight, age, and carrying capacity.</li>
        <li>Double Checking that all skills and feats have been chosen.</li>
        <li>Saving some spending money for the beginning of the game.</li>
      </ul>
