    <h1>Character Creation</h1>
    <h3>“In war or peace, information is all. Without aware ears and eyes, who would even know when peace turns to war? An assassin in your employ is a liability if he is fooled into killing the wrong target. The mightiest arcanist or witch is next to helpless if she believes her foe to be her dearest friend. Everyone miscalculates at times. Everyone has weaknesses. Know the information that keeps your allies happy and useful. Give it to them. Know the information that would displease them or turn them against you. Eliminate it. Silence those who would reveal it or learn even more dangerous secrets about them.”<br> — Iranez of the Orb, Arclord of Nex</h3>

      <h2>Step 1: Consult the Players Guide</h2>
      <h3>The players guide contains many details regarding the campaign and is a great resource specifically for planning your character. Many topics in the following sections refer to the players guide or contain excerpts from the players guide. While you do not need to read the entire guide, it is recomended to read as much of it as you can, or at least open a copy of it while creating your character, to make referencing easier.</h3>
      <p>A copy of the players guide may be found <a href="attachments/players-guide.pdf">HERE</a>.</p>
      <p><b>WARNING!</b> Due to the specific events of this campaign, players will not be able to create a new character after the intial character-creation phase. It will be difficult (but not impossible) to retrain class levels and feats, but many things are permanent once selected. It may also be wise to plan to build a character with a high survivability, such as choosing feats that help them live, or choosing classes that protect the character from death (or even cause ressurection or reincarnation in the event of such).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 2: Choose a Class</h2>
      <h3>Get an idead for the kind of character you want to play. Magic or Melee? Tactical or Straigt Forward? Highly Skilled or Powerful? Team Oriented or Loner? Choosing a class is the first step in building your character.</h3>
      <p>There are no restrictions on classes, though the Players Guide has some advice. Classes that rely on a certain degree of stable infrastructure, especially urban-focused classes and archetypes, may have a harder time. Characters with some ability to navigate effectively or have the ability to travel faster will find pratical applications for their skills frequently.</p>
      <p>Given their prevelence in Lastwall, paladins are an obvious choice, as are clerics and warpriests, but players of such characters shuold do so with an open mind, as many important growth moments in the Adventure Path require working alongside the lesser of two evils for the betterment of the world. It's worth pointing out that even the paladin code allows lawful good characters to work alongside evil companions for the greater good, so long as they can curb the dark actions of their allies.</p>
      <p>Other classes well suited for Tyrants Grasp include fighters, rangers, rogues, and qizards. Druids - residents of the nearby Fangwood Forest - are likewise a local feature, though druid players may find the desolate landscapes limiting. Because of the numerous undead opponents, bards (as well as enchanters and illusionists) may find fewer targets for their magic and songs. Characters reliants on using very specific equipment will struggle due to the scarcity of resources and shopping opportunities, particularly in the begining.</p>
      <p>Monks, cavaliers, and inquisitors are represented well in Lastwall, and even summoners and witches are left in peace so long as their gifts aren;t turned toward destruction or control. Brawlers, hunters, investigatos, and slayers are also among the nation's heroes, as well as spiritualists and mediums who handle the omnipresent lingering restless spirits.</p>
      <p>Classes of a chaotic bent - barbarians and skalds especially - are not undeard of, but are not well represented amond the notably honor-bound culture of Lastwall and may have a hard time finding kindred spirits or welcoming aid.</p>
      <p>Finally, a caution is given to characters reliant on animal companions, cohorts, familiars, or mounts, with the exception of the witch and the shaman, as those creatures will be seperated from the player near the begining of the adventure, though their aid and companionship may prove invaluable throughout the campaign once reunited (or replaced).</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Step 3: Rolling Stats</h2>
      <h3>Stat rolls must be done in person with the GM, so they will not be detailed heavily here. Depending on stats, the chosen character concept and class may need to be tweaked. If the stats rolled are not to the players liking, they may choose to default to a 20-point buy.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 4: Filling in the Character</h2>
      <h3>Every character has elements of the following. Click on each section as needed to expand the details. It is HIGHLY recommended to view each section in order, as they each contain critical information.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="asset">
      <section>
        <h3>Race</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Races">
        <p>Races for this campaign are partially restricted. Anyone may play the following races, sorted by order of prevelence in Lastwall: Human (Taldan, Chelaxian, Varisian, Kellid, Garundi, Keleshite, Tian), Half-Orc, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome, Elf, and Half-Elf. Aasimar and Dhampirs are also permitted, though they are treated generally with a certain level of mistrust - dhampirs for their obvious ties to undeath, and aasimars for their otherworldly origins.</p>
        <p>Changelings, Duskwalkers, and Skinwalkers are uncommon enough to not draw too much attention, and as such may be played by any player with a limit of no more than one of each race. These races may be chosen on a first-come, first-serve basis. Subject to GM approval, up to one player may play a race not listed above.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Archetypes</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Archetypes">
        <p></p>
        <p>The players guide has a lengthy list of suggested class archetypes, which will not be covered here.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Alignment Chart">
        <p>Every character must have an alignment, showing their outlook on ethics and morality respectively. Each character must be either Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral ethically and either Good, Evil, or Neutral morally. If you have a hard time understanding these alignments, please consult your GM.</p>
        <p>The nation of Lastwall (the central location for this campaign) is Lawful Good, so characters who are Lawful Good or their immediate neighbors, Lawful Nuetral and Nuetral Good, are the most common alignments and will be most at home. Lawful evil and chaotic nuetral characters are allowed, though discouraged, as it will be more difficult for them to get by in the game and interact peaceably with the party. True Evil (nuetral evil) and Chaotic Evil are not permitted in this campaign.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Campaign Trait</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Campaign Trait">
        <p>Every player gets two traits during character creation. Players may take a drawback trait to get up to one extra trait (total of three). One of these traits must be used to select a campaign trait, which ties the character into the area and serves throughout the campaign. No player may have more than one campaign trait, and no two players may select the same campaign trait.</p>
        <p>Campaign traits are detailed in the player's guide and will only be listed here by their names. They are: The Artisan, The Lawbringer, The Optimist, The Outsider, The Pessimist, The Reclaimer, The Snoop, and The Word.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Religious Views</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Religion">
        <p>Faith is a cornerstone of Lastwall's culture, and nearly every citezen pays homage, whether casual or devout, to one or more gods on a regular basis. While selecting dieties to worship is not required, it is recommended.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming majority of the people of Lastwall follow Iomedae, followed closely by the war god Gorum. Most soldiers worship both. Other gods commonly seen in Lastwall include the Taldan pantheon - Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Norgorber, and Shelyn. Less commonly, Sarenrae, Desna, Torag, and the rest of the Dwarven Pantheon may be found. There are also many cults to the various Empyreal Lords, especially Ragathiel and Andoletta.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Feats</h3>
        <img src="images/unknown.png" alt="Feats">
        <p>Every player gets one feat at first level, and every odd numbered level thereafter. They may also get bonus feats from their classes, race, or archetypes.</p>
        <p>PC's are recommended to dedicate themselves to one or more combat feat trees. With undead as a common feature, feats like Power Attack and Cleave will be handy, as will be feats that boost Fortitude and Will saving throws. The Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat will aid spellcasters in engaging incoporeal undead, and feats augmenting channel energy class features will likewise prove useful.</p>

      <h2>Step 5: Finalization</h2>
      <h3>Please audit your character to make sure nothing has been forgotten. It may be wise to check your character sheet with the GM. Also, check with your GM if anything is confusing, if you need help with any of these steps, or if you are concerend about how something in your character build may interact with the campaign world or the party.</h3>
      <p>Your characters personality and familial details will also be important and need to be determined before the comencement of the capaign. Work with your GM to plan these, but understand that most characters will probably need: Likes, Dislikes, Fears, Aspirations, Parents, Parental Relationship, and Close Relationship Details such as information regarding a current or former spouse, sibling, or child.</p>
      <p>Double check your character, and make sure you know how your character fits in the community (whether or not they already know the other players). Whether they were raised here, are temporarily stationed here, came here to set up shop or find work, or thought hey were just passing through, your character should have been living in Rosler's Coffer (the starting location of the game) for at least the last year, and preferably at least the last ten years.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">Some commonly overlooked items are:</b>
        <li>Calculating skill bonus totals, base attack bonuses, total health, saving throws, and combat modifiers.</li>
        <li>Choosing Spells Known and Spells Prepped.</li>
        <li>Determining your characters height, weight, age, and carrying capacity.</li>
        <li>Double Checking that all skills and feats have been chosen.</li>
        <li>Saving some spending money for the beginning of the game.</li>
      </ul>
