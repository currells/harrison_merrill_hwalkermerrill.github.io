    <h3><i>“The new recruits can often be found staring at the relics in awe, whispering the stories they’ve heard since they were children to one another. Holy, they call them—and make no mistake, they are holy, but not in the way that people wish it. Every one of these trinkets is a tombstone, a memorial to a war so brutal that the mere act of surviving it made you a hero. Every bloodstained scrap of iron that lies behind glass or locked in a safe is all that remains of thousands of soldiers who died in the mud so that a few lucky souls could be hailed as legends. People look at our relics and speak of courage and glory, but not a one of them was worth the price we paid in people. Can you imagine what we could have had, if they’d lived instead? The art, the progress, the families they would have made?”</i><br> — Jaqualine Cairr, Knight of Lastwall</h3>

        <h3>The hide of the Gorgon of Lastwall</h3>
        <img src="images/gorgon-lastwall.jpg" alt="The Gorgon of Lastwall">
        <p>The Gorgon of Lastwall terrorized the countryside near modern-day Roseler's Coffer during the times of the Shinning Crusade. There were not enough resources available to dedicate troops to stopping the beast, so Rosler went searching for it. Whenh they crossed paths, it charged Rosler, only to get its horns stuck in a tree. Rosler weathered the ebasts foul breath and stabbed the beast through the heart between its metal-plated skin just as it broke free, slaying the beast and saving the poor farmers living nearby.</p>
        <p>The hide of this gorgon is massive and damaged, but useful for more than just a trophy. In it's current state, it counts as broken Hide armor, though it has an armor bonus of +6, a Maximum Dex bonus of +3, an armor check penalty of -6, and weighs 75lbs. If properly fit and repaired, it will provide an armor bonus of +7, have the maximum dex bonus and armor check penalty of masterwork hide armor, and weigh 50lbs.</p>
        <p>Gorgon hide counts as a natural material for druid abilities, but otherwise counts as a metal. It also counts as heavy armor for the purposes of speed, though it only requires medium armor proficiency to wear. A creature wearing Gorgon Hide gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist being turned to stone or petrified. If a creature wearing Gorgon Armor has a breath weapon, once per day they may trade 3 uses of their breath weapon to breath a 60-ft. cone of Gorgon gas. Anyone caught in the cone must make a fortitude save with the same DC as their regular breath weapon, after which they can't use their breath weapon for 1d4+1 minutes. Gorgon Armor is always considered masterwork.</p>
