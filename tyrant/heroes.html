    <h3>Reputation and Renown: Villagers from Rosler's Coffer</h3>
    <div class="row">

        <h2>Leader Details: Mayor Grive</h2>
        <p>A practical and no-nonsense politician, Mayor Grive has helped Roslar's Coffer survive hardship and rebuild by recognizing when to take action and when she's in over her head and taking the sensible approach until the proper authorities arrive.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Action Plan: Midsummer Pageant</h2>
        <p>The Seventh Day of Erastus is celebrated with a Midsummer Pageant by most hunting and farming villages and small towns throughout the Inner Sea, a holdover among the small communities of thanksgiving to Erastil even among nations where the worship of Erastil is largely forgotten or neglected. Roslar's Coffer is no exception, using the day to give thanksgiving to Old Deadeye, seeking his blessing on their hunts and harvests, and using the tradition as an excuss to take a break from the regular work in the fields. With their primary resource being flax, which is used to feed, build, and clothe the capital of Lastway, Vigil, the Midsummer Pageant is also a time of recognition for the people of Roslar's Coffer, a time where their efforts and contribution towards the nations common good is most recognized.</p>
        <p>The Midsummer Pageant has the whole town of Rosler's Coffer on display - the town square has been swept clean and filled with merchant's showcasing their best wares, carnival games for children and adults with prizes to be won, performances by aspiring bards and entertainers, brewmasters and bakers handing out samples of their creations, and militia keeping the crowds safe and civil. Tournaments are held in the flax fields where the seeds are germinating safely beneath the soil before the first few sprouts break the surface, giving a chance for people to demonstrate their various hunting skills through archery, falconry, fishing, peasant jousting, strength and skill, and tracking competitions. The Sarenite temple has all of their relics on display mixed in with local art, free food, professional bardic music echoing about the walls, and the clergy are freely offering blessings upon families, livestock, and crafts brought before them.</p>
        <p>The capstone on the pageant is in the offering given to Erastil by the town's mayor, Lady Milliana Grive, along with her public prayer to Erastil for a blessing on the towns work and harvest, Shelyn for healing and hope, Gorum for strength and valor, and Iomedae for protection and peace. The relic being presented this year is a treasure from Vigil - a piece of the <i>Shattered Shield of Arnisant</i>, the shield made and wielded by Aroden's own mortal hand when he slayed Tar-Baphon, the same shield wielded by General Arnisant when he rallied the faltering Shinning Crusade alongside and led even the mortal Iomedae against the Whispering Tyrant, and the same shield that destroyed that Tyrant's power when the risen lich used a wish to summon General Arnisant's heart into his hand only to be defeated by the shield's protective magic. With more than a thousand years of history and reverence, and with the shield being instrumental in the defeat of Tar-Baphon each time, this piece is a piece of history, of magic, of the power of gods, and of the reason for Lastwall's existence. It is an honor to see a piece with one's own eyes, and rummor has it that the winner of each of the Erastian Tournaments will have the priveledge of touching the piece personally.</p>
