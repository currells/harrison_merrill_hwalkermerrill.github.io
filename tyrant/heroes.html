    <h3><i>&nbsp;“There is no need for suffering. Pain and sorrow are merely the symptoms of life. And what is life but a disease whose only cure is death? How many times have you heard the ill wailing in agony over festering sores that won’t heal, or watched a child stand crying at his parents’ grave, or passed an old woman in rags reaching out a bony hand for a bit of bread to sustain her a little longer? I have seen these things time and time again. Existence need not be so crude. It can be far more dignified, far more peaceful. Won’t you let me show you the relief we can offer the world?”</i> <br> — Dr. Lavinia Penrose, physician and Whispering Way practitioner</h3>

        <!-- <h2>Leader Details: Mayor Grive</h2>
        <p>A practical and no-nonsense politician, Mayor Grive has helped Roslar's Coffer survive hardship and rebuild by recognizing when to take action and when she's in over her head and taking the sensible approach until the proper authorities arrive.</p> -->
      </section>
      <section>
        <!-- <h2>Action Plan: Follow the Dead Roads back to Rosler's Coffer</h2>
        <p>The last request of Mayor Grive: <i>“I suppose, at least, there will still be someone on the other side who still remembers us. Just please, promise me that you’ll find out what happened to us when you get back, and that you’ll go to the capital and tell them what killed the people of Roslar’s Coffer.”</i></p> -->
        <!--<h2>Action Plan: Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape</h2>
        <p>Currently, lost and stranded, everyone is just trying to stay alive.</p>-->
        <h2>Action Plan: Midsummer Pageant</h2>
        <p>The Seventh Day of Erastus is celebrated with a Midsummer Pageant by most hunting and farming villages and small towns throughout the Inner Sea, a holdover among the small communities of thanksgiving to Erastil even among nations where the worship of Erastil is largely forgotten or neglected. Roslar's Coffer is no exception, using the day to give thanksgiving to Old Deadeye, seeking his blessing on their hunts and harvests, and using the tradition as an excuss to take a break from the regular work in the fields. With their primary resource being flax, which is used to feed, build, and clothe the capital of Lastway, Vigil, the Midsummer Pageant is also a time of recognition for the people of Roslar's Coffer, a time where their efforts and contribution towards the nations common good is most recognized.</p>
        <p>The Midsummer Pageant has the whole town of Rosler's Coffer on display - the town square has been swept clean and filled with merchant's showcasing their best wares, carnival games for children and adults with prizes to be won, performances by aspiring bards and entertainers, brewmasters and bakers handing out samples of their creations, and militia keeping the crowds safe and civil. Tournaments are held in the flax fields where the seeds are germinating safely beneath the soil before the first few sprouts break the surface, giving a chance for people to demonstrate their various hunting skills through archery, falconry, fishing, peasant jousting, strength and skill, and tracking competitions. The Sarenite temple has all of their relics on display mixed in with local art, free food, professional bardic music echoing about the walls, and the clergy are freely offering blessings upon families, livestock, and crafts brought before them.</p>
        <p>The capstone on the pageant is in the offering given to Erastil by the town's mayor, Lady Milliana Grive, along with her public prayer to Erastil for a blessing on the towns work and harvest, Shelyn for healing and hope, Gorum for strength and valor, and Iomedae for protection and peace. The relic being presented this year is a treasure from Vigil - a piece of the <i>Shattered Shield of Arnisant</i>, the shield made and wielded by Aroden's own mortal hand when he slayed Tar-Baphon, the same shield wielded by General Arnisant when he rallied the faltering Shinning Crusade alongside and led even the mortal Iomedae against the Whispering Tyrant, and the same shield that destroyed that Tyrant's power when the risen lich used a wish to summon General Arnisant's heart into his hand only to be defeated by the shield's protective magic. With more than a thousand years of history and reverence, and with the shield being instrumental in the defeat of Tar-Baphon each time, this piece is a piece of history, of magic, of the power of gods, and of the reason for Lastwall's existence. It is an honor to see a piece with one's own eyes, and rummor has it that the winner of each of the Erastian Tournaments will have the priveledge of touching the piece personally.</p>

    <h2>Obol Abnormalities: Changes Discovered since the Midsummer Pageant</h2>
    <div class="asset">
      <section>
        <h3>Drawback Trait: Hard to Stabilize</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/psychopomp-reaper.jpg" alt="Death Waiting">
        <p>Death seems to be waiting for you, ready to take you at a moment's notice. It is impossible to stabilize when dying or disabled; When you begin a turn with 0hp or less, you immediately take 1 point of damage and lose the benefits of any <i>Fast Healing</i> and <i>Regeneration</i> until you are slain or you recover. This replaces the need to attempt stabilization checks.</p>
      </section>
      <!-- <section>
        <h3>Trait: Hungry for Life</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/psychopomp-flock.jpg" alt="Overhealing">
        <p>Your body is able to contain more life than seems possible. When you gain hp via positive energy effects, such as <i>Cure Light Wounds</i> or <i>Lay on Hands</i>, you are able to heal above your maximum hp. Any healing above your maximum hp becomes temporary hp, with a maximum of 1 temporary hp per die rolled (or per caster level for spells or effects that heal a set amount per caster level, such as <i>Heal</i>), including any existing temporary hp.</p>
        <p>Your soul seems to crave this excess life, which fills your character with a modicum of euphoria. However, this also results in all temporary hp decaying at a rate of 1/minute, regardless of its source, as though damage is being taken.</p>
        <p>If your temporary hp ever equals or exceeds your constitution score, your body tears at its seams as your soul rapidly escapes, causing your body to explode with radiant positive energy, slaying you and destroying your body completely. All creatures within thirty feet are healed or harmed by 1d4 points of positive energy per hit die you possessed as <i>channel positive energy</i>, with a Will save DC of 10 + HD for half. All objects on your person take an equal amount of damage, though intelligent objects may attempt a Will save.</p>
      </section> -->
      <!-- <section>
        <h3>Strange Whispers and Dreams</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/psychopomp-girl.jpg" alt="Whispers and Dreams">
        <p>Over time, strange whispers beign to slowly overwhelm your senses, and strange dreams permiate your sleep, your mind is bombarded by aspirations, memories, and tragedies not your own.</p>
        <p>You can never be immune to magical sleep, or to the staggered, stunned, fatigued, exhausted, or unconcious conditions. While these conditions can be suppressed or recovered from naturally, they cannot be removed via magical or extraordinary means. The penalties from fatigued and exhausted apply to Wisdom in addition to Strength and Dexterity.</p>
        <p>If you ever reach an effective Wisdom of 0 or less, in addition to any other effects, your character becomes permanently confused until your wisdom recovers, except every time you attempt to act normally or babble, you are instead placed under the GM's control, as you are overwhelmed by the whispers.</p>
        <p>Any time you die or rest for at least one hour, you to experience strange dreams as prescribed by your character trait, and may level if you have the experience to do so. If leveling but not experiencing a full nights rest, you increase your maximum hp as usual, but your current hp does not, and any new daily uses of limited abilities, such as spell slots or rage rounds, are considered expended.</p>
        <p>Each time you experience these whispers, you lose a little of yourself as your souls quintescence withers, manifesting as a sure knowledge that you are losing your own memories and a feeling of being increasingly stretched and worn thin. This may occasionally result in other complications, as chosen by the GM, particularly during situations your characters find "stressful".</p>
      </section> -->
      <!-- <section>
        <h3>Obol Resonant Power - Positive Polarity</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/psychopomp-sword.jpg" alt="Obol Polarity">
        <p>You are resistant to the negative power and magical undeath of the Nothing and find yourself uniquely suited for surviving it's assualts and overcoming the defenses and resistances of its anti-life creations</p>
        <p>The Obol harmlessly absorbs a portion of negative energy effects you are exposed to. A number of points of negative energy equal to twice your hit dice is harmlessly absorbed from every given source or attack (or round for enviornmental effects) before (and stacking with) any of your other resistances are applied.</p>
        <p>The Obol also protects you (possibly against your will) from the magical powers of necromancy. This imparts spell resistance equal to 11 + your hit dice against all necromancy spells. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered and also applies against any spells you cast. You cannot be corrupted by unlife and made into a creature of the undead type or subtype.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Obol is also breaches some of the protections of undead. This causes all of your natural and melee weapon attacks to be treated as magic, cold iron, and silver for the purposes of overcoming the damage reduction of undead targets. This has no effect on ranged attacks, including attacks with thrown weapons.</p>
      </section> -->
      <!-- <section>
        <h3>Special Quality: Banished from Death</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/psychopomp-scarecrow.jpg" alt="Banished from Death">
        <p>Your soul has been pinned permanenrly to your body and you have been banished from death. This banishment is a blessing and a curse, forcing your body to reform as long as your soul is not destoyed.</p>
        <p>The first time each day you are slain, your body returns to life after one hour at 1hp. The increased potency of the effect of the strange whispers and dreams during this time, and its accompanying loss of quintescence, results in losing an amount of xp equal to half the difference between your current and next level. This experience loss may result in actual level loss, but no more than one.</p>
        <p>If you cannot or choose not to return to your body, your body was mangled, destroyed, or killed via a death effect, you already died previously that day, or your otherwise unable to be restored, your body instead crumbles to dust after one hour, along with all equipment still on your person, and any items boded to your character - wherever they are in the world. During this time, your strange dreams are particularly vivid and lucid, after which you respawn after a long rest in a place chosen by the GM, typically within 1 mile of another Obol. These especially vivid dreams drain even more of your quintescence, resulting in enough experience loss to lose one full level and all excess xp, though the intermingling of these strange memories allows a player to reassign their class level choices.</p>
        <p>All intelligent creatures have a self-image, and the Obol binds that image to your soul, creating bonded items, which the Obol will cause to manifest each time you are reconstructed by draining its energy when your old body crumbles into dust. Your clothing and any one item required for your class (such as a spellbook or divine focus) along with any items with the bonded item class feature (like a wizards staff) are automatically bonded, along with a number of items equal to half the creatures charisma modifier (minimum zero). Bonding to a contianer, such as a backpack or bag of holding, will not preserve its contents - while seemingly identicle, the item is different. You do, however, always retain all items stored in an extradimensional space related to a spell or ability, so long as that ability is retained and has not expired. Bonded items must have been on your person at the time of death, and while new and distinct items, are reformed in a similar condition. Consumable items may be selected in bundles of 10, non-reusable ammunition in bundles of 100, and coins in bundles of 1,000.</p>

    <!-- <h2>Mythical Powers Granted by the Explosion</h2>
    <div class="asset">
      <section>
        <h3>Quintessence Syphon</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/unknown.png" alt="Quintessence Syphon">
        <p>You have been cursed - or blessed - with the power to syphon away a portion of the quintessence, the building blocks of souls and the outer planes, from things you destroy. This happens automatically, as the Obol absorbs the remaining potential from creatures slain. If the creature or object had the same number of HD as you or less, this quintessence is wasted. If they had more HD than you, the Obol rejuvinates, granting one point of mythic power, while any HD not used to restore mythic power instead rejuvinates a portion of your soul, restoring one year of your life per HD they had more than you. If this would reduce your age category, you only gain the benefits of this change. You cannot restore yourself to life before becoming an adult, as that is considered your body's peak condition.</p>
        <p>As an immediate action, you may spend one mythic point to attempt to syphon all of your targets quintessence, instead of just a portion. This decision must be made before the Obol begins syphoning any energy, so the Obol will not yet have restored a mythic point and the targets HD may still be unknown. The target must attempt a will save equal to the Spell Resistance granted by your Obol. If they succeed, none of their energy is syphoned away. If they fail, your Obol absorbs their all of their quintessence, including that building their body, and destroying the essence of their life, such as their soul. Fully absorbed creatures may only be restored via a miracle, and only by a diety.</p>
        <p>If a creature or object is fully absorbed, your entire mythic pool is restored, with any remaining energy rejuvinating your soul of double the normal amount. You also heal a number of hitpoints equal to your mythic tier times the number of years restored when fully absorbing a creature.</p>
        <p>This replaces <i>Hard to Kill</i> and the mythic attack ability normally gained at first level. You may gain the normal mythic attack ability of your tier by spending one path ability.</p>

        <h3>Obol Power</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/unknown.png" alt="Obol Power">
        <p>The Obol pinning your body and soul to this world empowers you to acomplish amazing deeds... at a price. You gain pool of mythic power equal to twice your mythic tier. This pool of mythic power is recharged at the moment of dawn at the place where the Obol pierced your body and soul - regardless of where you are at the time. This power is drawn from your remaining potential, resulting in you ageing one year per point filling your pool, regardless of how many points may have been unspent at the time. This ageing bypasses any immunities or longevity, and always provides penalties but never any benefits assosiated with increased age. You cannot become immune to ageing in any way, and are not subject to spells or effects that reduce or negate ageing effects or penalties.</p>
        <p>You can only gain daily uses of mythic power due to this effect and <i>Quintessence Syphon</i>. You can never have more than your maximum daily amount of mythic power. This alters, replaces, and counts as <i>Mythic Power</i></p>

        <h3>Arazni's Vengeance</h3>
        <img src="/images/unknown.png" alt="Arazni's Gift">
        <p>The desire for vengeance by Aroden's former herald is so great, it inspires you to strike decisively. As a swift action, by expending one use of mythic power, you may move up to your speed. At any point during this movement, you may make a single ranged or melee attack at your highest attack bonus, or cast a damage-dealing spell targeting a single creature, adding your tier to any attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round.</p>
        <p>When you declare this attack, you may choose to align your attack. An aligned attack bypasses any damage reduction or resistances (but not immunities) of targets opposite your alignment or within one step of opposite, and automatically hits (and denies saving throws) to creatures exactly opposite your alignment. If the target is not within one step of the opposite of your alignment, this attack automatically missess and their saving throws automatically succeed. True nuetral creatures are never affected by an aligned attack, and true nuetral characters cannot align their attacks.</p>
        <p>If you are true nuetral, beyond alignment, have multiple alignments, or have a flexible alignment, you may choose your alignment for the purpose of this effect when you restore your mythic power each day. This choice may come in the form of a mental adjustment, a prayerful pledge, or something similar. Destroying evil creatures with Arazni's Vengeance is considered a good act, destroying lawful creatures is considered chaotic, and vice-versa.</p>
        <p>If a target is destroyed by Arazni's Vengeance, you gain a sacred bonus to your initiative equal to your tier, which stacks with itself but not with other sacred bonuses/ This replaces <i>Amazing Initiative</i></p>

        <h3>Tyrant's Rest</h3>
        <img src="/images/unknown.png" alt="Arazni's Gift">
        <p>Haunted by the Tyrant's Whispers, the only rest you find is in your strange dreams. By expending one or more points of mythic power and meditating for one hour, you can force yourself to have another strange dream. Following your dream, you regain a number of hit points equal to half your regular total, and count as having spent up to a number of days equal to the number of mythic points expended attempting to retrain skill ranks, feats, class features, or class levels with a trainer. You cannot meditate in this way more than once per day, and you cannot perform any other downtime-activities on days where you use mythic power to retrain existing features or abilities.</p>
        <p>This replaces <i>Recuperation</i></p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Precision is important in getting exactly what you want, and you give careful consideration in building everything from homes and vases to roads and empires. Your own attention to detail has proven vital in rebuilding Roslar’s Coffer from the orc occupation a decade ago, whether you are an accountant, architect, engineer, or herbalist.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your attention to detail provides you a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Heal checks, and one of these skills becomes a class skill for you. Once per day, you can spend a full round casting a spell you can cast that has a normal casting time of 1 standard action to increase your effective caster level for that spell by 1. This ability has no affect on spells with a casting time other than 1 standard action.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Construction Detail - Whether you're an accountant, architect, engineer, herbalist, or have a different profession, you have been very helpful in the reconstrcution efforts of Roslar's Coffer. Due to your skill and attention, you now find yourself helping with the design and implementation of current expansions while most of the other workers have either returned to the fields or else sought employment in Vigil. You gain 50gp in spending money at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>The stability and prosperity of your job has afforded you a small house and the time to settle down with a family. Whether you have been married for a long time or are currently engaged, you have a significant other with whom you are in love. You may or may not have children already, but either your significant other is with child or the two of you have recently adopted a baby.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - Since the explosion, whenever you close your eyes and try to calmly concentrate, you see a vast library of books, all plain and without any cover. Wandering the library with you are people shelving books, some of whom you recognize as your ancestors.</p>

        <h3>The Lawbringer</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/unknown.png" alt="Lawbringer">
        <p><b>Description:</b> The frontier is a land of risk and disorder, and while people are welcome to brave those elements themselves, they all too often bring pain down upon folk who never wanted such a risk. You might serve on the town guard or as part of a detachment of soldiers supported by Vigil, or you could be simply a concerned farmer who endures when others cannot, but your purpose is to stand as a bulwark against the cruel whims of fate for anyone who needs it.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If you have the aura of courage class feature, the bonus provided by your aura increases by 1. Your courage is inspiring; the first time each day you are knocked unconscious or killed, all allies within 30 feet of you immediately gain a number of temporary hp equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier, as they rally to your defense. These temporary hp last for 1 minute.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Militia - Whether you were a farmer, a town guard, or a soldier from Vigil, your base pay now stems from your work in Roslar's Militia and your defense of Roslar's Coffer. You gain 10gp in spending money at the start of the game as well as a masterwork light shield as part of your uniform.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>Whether you grew up here or not, your closest family are the brothers and sisters in arms you serve with. You have a best friend, a human named Jerod Catarina, that has been serving here as long as you. You and he may be in a budding relationship, but things haven't gotten serious yet, or you else your relationship may be completely platonic but no less deep. The two of you have been saving for months to get a small flat together and move out of the barracks.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - You have always fallen back on your training in times of crisis, but didn't expect to see the training before you when you close your eyes. You see formations of hundreds of soldier's, brothers in arms, across centuries of armor and formation styles, all drilling and training together with impossibly perfect precision and cohesion.</p>

        <h3>The Optimist</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/pc-jasmin-jj-jasper.jpg" alt="Optimist">
        <p><b>Description</b> People don't need to take your word that things are getting better; they only need to look around and see the proof before their eyes. The town's recovery from the orc occupation more than a decade ago is all but complete, and the monster in the Sarenite temple outside of town has finally been bested. Your irrepressible sense of optimism seems to fly in the face of the hard life that most residents of Roslar’s Coffer face, but you’re convinced that your positive attitude lifts up your community.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Further, your optimism can be infectious. As a swift action a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can grant this bonus to an ally within 10 feet. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Hobbyist - You have pursued both work and hobbies in equal measure since you found a burried cache of treasure while clearing away some rubble during the reconstruction a few years ago. You gain 1,000gp and five sets of fine clothing worth 50gp each at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>You own a small manor house where you live with your family. Your living parents reside in the attached guest house, and you share your home with your spouse or significant other and two children. Alternatively, you could live here with your brother and his family.</p>
        <p></b> - Your good luck and attitude have served you well so far, and they continue when you close your eyes. You see a thriving city, filled with happy people and music, when you close your eyes, each person trying to tell you a different story, though you can't seem to understand them.</p>

        <h3>The Outsider</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/pc-eideard.jpg" alt="Outsider">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You don't have a place, but the frontier seems comfortable enough for now. Maybe you're too informal for city life, too selfish for Lastwall's general culture of camaraderie, or too scarred by things you've seen to entirely trust another person.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You are accustomed to moving without drawing much attention to yourself, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Accustomed to working alone, you gain only half the benefit (+1) from aid another actions, but you’re accustomed to doing the job right the first time and so increase the bonus you provide by 1 when aiding another character.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Migrant Worker - You don't have any formal or regular employment, preffering the transient lifestyle, even though its landed you here for a while. When you need money, you do odd jobs, and you've been able to get by just fine so far without commiting too much to anything. You gain 15gp and a pet worth 50gp or less at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>Regardless of your relationship with the rest of your family, they are far away right now. You may have had lovers or companions, but no one permanent. Your only real family is your pet, who has been with you since shortly after you left home. The two of you are staying at the Inn, Rosler's Room's and Recs, for the time being.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - You used to dream of fantastic places to visit and adventures to be had, but since the explosion, the landscapes have become far more detailed and vivid. You can see, smell, hear, strange places youve never been and see other travelers on the road journeying with you.</p>

        <h3>The Pessimist</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/pc-vyra-matthews.jpg" alt="Pessimist">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You expect the worst and have rarely been disappointed. Your dour outlook may hail from the original destruction of Roslar's Coffer at the hands of the Twisted Nail tribe, the exile of the faithful from the nearby Sarenite temple, or some more personal misfortune, but it has set you apart among the largely forward-thinking population of Lastwall.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your faith that the worst possible outcome will occur grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. Your frustrating pessimism can spur friends to succeed just to spite you; once per day as a free action, you can force an ally within 30 feet to reroll a saving throw she just failed, using the better of the two results.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Beggar - You haven't been able to hold down a job longer than a few weeks for the past few years, giving you a terrible streak of poverty and bad employment history. You've now worked for nearly everyone in Rosler's Coffer, and none care for your attitude enough to put up with your talents. You gain 5gp at the start of the game in copper and silver from begging today.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>Your spouse betrayed you in the wrost way, they killed your son (either biological or adopted) and raised them as an Attic Whisperer out of some perveted view of life and death after becoming a follower of the whispering way. You testified against them and had them executed, but the event still haunts you, leaving you with a melancholy outlook towards both friends and lovers generally.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - Your bad luck and attitude have kept you alive, but they haunt your waking dreams. You see the dead, including loved ones and former friends, when you close your eyes. Some yell at you, some plead with you, and others try to speak with you, but you can't hear what they're saying even when you try to listen.</p>

        <h3>The Reclaimer</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/pc-raissel-vashti.jpg" alt="Reclaimer">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You lost something precious in the destruction of Roslar's Coffer 12 years ago—a home, a legacy, perhaps even family—but returned because a soul shouldn't run from pain, but heal from it. Rebuilding your life and preventing that same hurt from dragging down others drives you to serve and protect, perhaps as a politician, charity worker, healer, or soldier, but that same loss fills you with an uncharitable anger that is often difficult to reconcile.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your wary eyes grant you a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls against any opponent that dealt hit point damage to one of your allies in the previous round.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Public Servant - Whether you've chosen to be a politician, charity worker, healer, or soldier, you work for Rosler's Coffer and have your living subsidized by a combination of taxes and donations. You gain a Medallion of Service worth 20gp at the start of the game and can eat and drink for free anywhere in Rosler's Coffer.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>Most of your family past away 12 years ago, whether this included siblings, parents, children, or a spouse, but that hasn't dampened your spirits. You have a blossoming love with someone in town, and are either courting, engaged, or newlyweds. They help bring you joy and ease the rages that sometimes rule you. You have no children, but may be planning on having some soon, and may have a pet cat, dog, or bird.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - You used to dream of your mistakes, reliving them over and over again in your own private hell. The content of your dreams is unchanged, though the format is new - you can move around, do things differently, change things. Mistakes are a wonderful teacher, every wrong leading you to the right descision until you feel... healed.</p>

        <h3>The Snoop</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/pc-dante-erebus.jpg" alt="Snoop">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You know a little bit about most everything and everyone in Roslar's Coffer. It may be your profession, as you could be an archivist, crier, or librarian—or you simply make a hobby of gossip.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You have a gift for recall and reading others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) checks, and these both become class skills for you. Once each day you can reroll a single Bluff or Sense Motive check against a creature you have known for at least 24 hours, using the better result.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Gossip - Or at least, that's what it would be if people paid you enough just for that. Whether your an archivist, crier, librarian, or simply a hobbyist, you've made it your <i>real</i> profession learning the lives of anyone and everyone. You gain 15gp and a gold ring worth 30gp that you got off someone in exchange for your discression at the start of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>You may have a spouse, or you may not, but you try your best to keep your families indescressions and foillies out of the limelight. This has led many to feel that your parents, spouse, sibblings, or children are more akin to shut-ins that real people. Whatever family you live with, one of them is a violent schizophrenic and the rest are extreem introverts, causing you to seek social interaction outside.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - Parties were a place to aspire to reach, to be invited to, to not just see but be seen! Somehow, you've found yourself at the center of a large party when you dream, a party where you are the Honored Guest and everyone is clammoring for your attention. They whisper to you things, secret things, things you know you need to remeber when you wake.</p>

        <h3>The Word</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/unknown.png" alt="Word">
        <p><b>Description:</b> In a nation overcrowded with faith, you often worry that your message is drowned out, but nonetheless important. The souls in Roslar's Coffer needed comfort and charity once upon a time, but have bounced back so fully—in part thanks to your hard work—that you worry you've made yourself unnecessary.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You are accustomed to long hours, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws. Your faith is invigorating, and once per day you can lay on hands as a paladin of half your character level (minimum 1). If you gain the lay on hands ability from a class, you instead gain one additional use of lay on hands each day.</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Priest - Regardless of your faith, you are a part of its paid ministry, and are integral to the community. You gain 15gp and a silver holy symbol of your choice at the beggining of the game.</p>
        <p><b>Family: </b>You live in a house owned by the church, possibly attached to a temple, have no serious relationships, and have largely considered yourself devoted to your diety. You may have a crush on someone in town, but they have not noticed you yet, though you are sure to soon try and grab their attentions.</p>
        <p><b>Strange Dreams: </b> - You have studied and daydreamed about the Great Beyond for much of your life, and find yourself dreaming of it each time your eyes close. Except the place is real - the walls, the floor, the open sky, the petitioners and the chosen - you are... home at last. The outsiders gather in a huddle, murmering to themselves quietly, before one is inevitably sent your way to grasp you by the hand and look deep into your eyes.</p>

        <h3>The Curious Clone</h3>
        <img src="/tyrant/images/reedreaper.jpg" alt="Curious Clone">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You spent centuries in the boneyard serving Mictena, the Psychopomp that saved you from a fate you didn't deserve, and have longed to live a life of your own. Your memories are clogged, some being your own, some being that of the person who traded their eternal punishment for your imprisonment, and some being that of the person whose place you traded with.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain all the bonuses of the campaign trait of the person you replaced, though your curious nature and mangled memories may have some unintended consequences.</p>
        <p><b>Mythic: </b>Choice - <b>Strange Dreams: </b> - Whenever you close your eyes, you see a blur of people, places, and things you feel you should know. Some you recognize but can't quite recollect, some your sure you know but don't know why, and some your sure you haven't met or seen yet but know you will. In this tumbling blur, a friendly face always emerges to thank you for everything you've done, and promise to help. You gain hp according to the mythic path you choose.</p>
