  <h1>Talmandor's Bounty Colony Charter</h1>
  <h3>Colony Status: Growing</h3>
  <div class="row">
    <section>
      <h2>Current Assignment</h2>
      <!-- <p>After a six-week voyage, the second wave of colonists, led by Ramona Avandth, arrived at Talmandor's Bounty, only to find the colony incomplete and devoid of colonists. After observing from a distance, Ramona directed the expedition team to go ashore and explore the colony carefully while Ramona took the ship and the rest of the colonists to the secondary landing location in hopes of finding the colonists in hiding there. Ramona intends to return at or around an hour past dawn on the following day, though if they are delayed and do not arrive the next morning, the expedition team is to travel up the shoreline to the secondary location and rendezvous with the rest of the colonists there.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>After their rendezvous at the secondary location, Ramona Advanth gathered the expedition report of Talmandor's Bounty, and directed the Colonial Marines to shuttle everyone back to the stranded ship. After giving the expedition team a chance to rest, the she directed them to try and resolve the issues with the ship, both above and below water, and assist with efforts to recolonize Talmandor's Bounty.</p> -->
      <p>After several months in Ancorato, the colonists from the first wave have been rescued, reinforcemnets have arrived, and the colony is growing at a brisk pace. While many are cheerfully continuing to build Talmandor's Bounty, the disturbing revelations of late have caused others to be fearful and doubtful. The aboleth Onthooth had been sending his servants to raid the colony for test subject stock and many of the original colonists are dead. And while Onthooth was slain by the expedition team, Onthooth alluded to serving someone greater - a veiled master - who seems to be searching through Azlanti Ruins for an ancient super-weapon.</p>
