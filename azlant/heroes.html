      <!--<h2>Employer Details</h2>
      <p>Slim and athletic, Princess Eutropia bears the distinctive cheekbones and nose of her Stavian father and grandmother. Despite the ostentatious jewelry she wears, her gown and hair are more conservative than that of most other nobles'. The Princess Eutropia is trying to become heir apparent for the Primogen Crown and campaigns for increased rights along with the shaking off of the shackles of some of Taldors traditions. While well educated, she is relatively naive and must grow a great deal to be worthy of the Primogen Crown.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">While preparing to lead, the Princess Eutropia learned some lessons from her agents' decisions:
        <li><br>Neglecting Malphene Trant, leading to her evetual suicide, taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - there simply isn't enough time to save everyone.</li>
        <li>Saving most of the nobles traped beneath the senate building taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - save whom you can, if you can.</li>
        <li>Sending a raiding party of Pathfinders before attacking the Silent Repository taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - resources are best used when coordinated.</li>
        <li>Killing Count Bartelby Lotheed taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - not everyone deserves mercy, and some deserve death.</li>
        <li>Allying with Baron Okerra over the Night Swan taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - good allies should be embraced.</li>
        <li>Exonerating Anllel Oakleaf during the Stachys Trials taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - just because its popular doesn't mean its right.</li>
        <li>Slaughtering some of the charmed townsfolk of Yanmass taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - things are easiest when obstacles are removed quickly.</li>
        <li>Befriending Gallindra Jonrek in the Yanmass City Park taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - those who fight against us may become valuable allies.</li>
        <li>Defeating the Kozan Bravos taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - while most opposition can be ignored, tenacious opposition is best subdued.</li>
        <li>Working to restore the petrified soldiers to life taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - nobody gets left behind or forgotten.</li>
        <li>Rescuing Cassandra Florint, who turned out to be a Lion Blade, from the Encircling Bower's dungeon taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - saving others can lead to them saving you.</li>
        <li>Attempting to bargin with the psychopomp Xan taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - anyone can make a good ally.</li>
        <li>Utilizing some of Milon Jeroth's spy network to assasinate Baron Astor Rhoderus taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - a tool may be wielded by any craftsman.</li>
        <li>Solving the murder of Tae Amalon taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - everyone matters, including the dead.</li>
        <li>Discovering Prince Stavian III was shocking, so he was taken by the Lion's Blades to a secluded retirement. This taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - Even if you love them, sometimes it's best to send people away.</li>
        <li>Killing Maxillar Pythareus taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - if people wont surrender, kill them where they stand.</li>
        <li>Siding with the raised Kalbio taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - even the smallest kindnesses can repay.</li>
        <li>Leaving Taldaris's grave goods undisturbed taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - regardless of the perceived personal gain, it is critical to do right.</li>
        <li>Killing the crowntop coup  taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - sometimes, there isn't enough time to barter, especially with the weak.</li>
        <li>Commiting the ultimate sacrifice to save Carrius taught Princess Eutropia a great lesson in <b>compassion</b> - family is critical, and self sacrifice can be incredibly noble.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Summary of Lessons Learned</b> - Efficiency: 5; Practicality: 6; Compassion: 10</p>

      <h3>Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian I - Eutropia the Kind</h3>
      <p>Kind words and extended hands proved more effective than drawn blades in winning Eutropia the throne, and she honors this simple truth through outreach and empathy for her subjects. Eutropia the Kind takes from those with much to give—the nobles, the merchants, and the coin generated by Taldor’s many trade routes—and invests it in the common good to provide education, medicine, and a higher standard of living to all Taldans. To ensure that the needs of even the meekest citizens are met, she borrows from Andoran philosophy and introduces a publicly elected counterpart to the Senate to advise on government policy. While her reforms make Eutropia the Kind wildly popular with the common citizens, her heavy taxes and flouting of Taldan tradition enrage the nobility. Her reign sees a resurgence in aristocratic conspiracies and secret societies dedicated to usurping the throne.</p>
