      <h3>Azlanti Longsword</h3>
      <img src="images/azlanti-xiphos.jpg" alt="Azlanti Longsword">
      <p>Inscibed with the name "Xiphos" this <i>+1 Azlanti Longsword</i> has an emerald crossguard wrapped in leather and gold wire and is glowing with a pale emerald light as per the spell <i>light</i>. Its remarkable condition suggests it is immune to the wear and rust of either water or time, while its gold wiring terminates in a bizare electro-thaumaturgic fuse.</p>
      <p>At the height of the Azlanti Empire, the electro-thaumaturgic fuse would gather ambient energy broadcast from the city, though that method of powering this sword is no longer possible. It can, however, be imitated through magic. A caster may specifically target <i>Xiphos</i> with a spell as though it were a living creature to empower the sword for a number of rounds equal to their casting modifier. This grants a bonus to attack and damage rolls on the weapons next attack, whether it hits an enemy or not, equal to the level of the spell used to empower the weapon, after which the spell is expended and not delivered to the target unless the wielder is capable of delivering spellstrikes. If this attack hits multiple targets, only the first target takes the bonus damage. This bonus damage does not stack with the Arcane Strike feat.</p>
      <p>If the wielder is capable of delivering a spellstrike with the spell used to empower <i>Xiphos</i>, they may hold the charge in the sword normally for up to a number of rounds equal to the casters casting modifier, even if they miss with an attack roll. A spell held in this way is still immediately discharged the first time it hits a creature, even if it normally allows for multiple touch attacks or if the wielder only uses the sword to deliver a touch spell, though the wielder may also choose to deliver the spell's effect normally via spellstrike upon contact in addition to the bonus damage.</p>

  <h2>Special Loot</h2>
  <h3>Click on an item to display details.</h3>
  <div class="active"></div>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle">Azlanti Headband of Bright Recollection
      <li style="display: none;">When touched to a creatures forehead, this block of copper breaks into 10 separate plates that begin floating around the creatures head 1" from their body. This forms a headband with a faint crimson energy field connecting the pieces until a creature pulls a piece more than 10" from their head, causing the pieces to reform into the copper block.</li>
      <li style="display: none;">This headband acts as a Headband of Ponderous Recollection (arcana), which emits a crimson light in the direction the wearer is looking any time they read, write, remember something (using a check) or otherwise concentrate (swift action). This light functions like a hooded lantern, emitting normal light in a 10ft. cone in the direction the character is looking, and dim light for 5ft. around the cone. Each time the light is activated, it remains lit for a number of rounds equal to the creatures K: Arcana ranks or until they dismiss the light (free action on their turn). If the character has 10 or more ranks in K: Arcana, they may choose to instead emit a bright light any time the device is active (with normal light for 10ft. and dim light for 10ft.) with the bright light portion counting as though it was generated by a daylight spell.</li>
      <li style="display: none;">This headband was specifically designed to function in conjunction with Crimson Sphere Ioun Stones, and orbiting Crimson Sphere Ioun Stones orbit within the same orbital plane. This function allows this headband to stack with them as though it were an identitical Crimson Sphere Ioun Stone, matching with the best one if multiple types are used being used simultaneously. In addition, if any Crimson Sphere Ioun Stone is orbiting within the same plane as the Headband of Bright Recollection, the headband offers a fourth piece of information when activated to reveal the abilities and weaknessess of a creature within line of sight, treating the wearer as though they rolled a natural 20 on their fourth turn.</li>
      <li style="display: none;">Price: 6,100gp</li>
