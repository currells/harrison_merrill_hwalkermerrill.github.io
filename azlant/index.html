        <li style="display: none;"><b>Citizenship:</b> All characters are Andoran Citizens (though they may be from elsewhere), and are treated as free and equal in all rights and privileges with respect to the law. Andoran does not have a nobility caste or slavery, and all slaves brought to Andoran are considered free.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Currency:</b> Andoran uses copper caps, silver wolves, gold sails, and platinum falcons, though they refer to all coins by these names and use them interchangably, regardless of mint origin.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Langauges:</b> As a former Taldan Province, the official language of Andoran is Common. Recommended languages include: Aboleth, Aquan, Azlanti, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Sylvan, Syrinx, Thassilonian, and Undercommon. Other useful languages include: Abyssal, Aklo, Auran, Boggard, Celestial, Cyclops, Dark Folk, Draconic, Ghol-Gan, Infernal, Orvian, Polyglot, and Sahuagin. Common regional dialects include: Shoanti, Varisian, and Vudrani.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Origins:</b> While most players should be natural born citizens of Andoran, as an egalitarian country, Andoran is filled with immigrants from all over Avistan and other parts of Golarion.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Racism:</b> Andoran prides itself on being welcoming and open, though many still regard monstrous humanoids and native outsiders, especially tieflings due to their proximity with Cheliax, with suspicion and occasional hatred.</li>

      <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Trait Options: Players must choose ONE of these traits upon character creation; no two players may share campaign traits:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Athletic:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You have always had a knack for physical activity. You either grew up in a rural area and had an active childhood where you were always climbing trees, swimming in lakes and rivers, and clambering up rocky hillsides, or you competed in and excelled at contests or sports while growing up in a larger settlement. Due to this background, little can slow you down or inhibit your movements. When the Bountiful Venture Company interviewed you, they noticed your stature and physicality, and they chose you for the colonial expedition knowing that a strong back is always helpful in a growing colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You reduce your armor check penalty by a number equal to one-third your character level (minimum 1) for purposes of Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to one of these three skills, chosen when you take this trait.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Tesswyn shows characters with the Athletic trait how to run with the reckless-abandon of a child, increasing their base speed by 5 feet.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Azlanti Scholar:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You are familiar with an aspect of Azlanti lore. Maybe you first became enamored with this ancient culture after stumbling across a copy of the first volume of the Pathfinder Chronicles or after learning about Azlant in a university or another type of formal education. Perhaps your parents or guardians were scholars and you’ve grown up hearing about and reading about the ancient Azlanti. For years you dreamed about visiting the continent’s ruins and returning with a discovery that could propel your career. Due to this scholarly bent, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you to join the colony at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Use Magic Device checks, and one of these skills is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain Azlanti as a bonus language.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Perrell Beys' tutilage allows Azlanti Scholars to learn new language in half the time and at no cost during downtime, and they gain Skill Focus in the skill they chose with the Azlanti Scholar trait as a bonus feat.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Eagle Knight Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> -  Since Talmandor’s Bounty is an Andoren colony and is unlikely to see the threat of slavery, the presence of the Eagle Knights isn’t strongly needed, and the Bountiful Venture Company would prefer to not have that organization immediately associated with the colony (despite the colony’s name having been derived from the Eagle Knights’ patron, Talmandor). However, the need for safety can’t be overlooked. You were a soldier in the Andoren army or you were a civilian who showed great promise in military matters. The Eagle Knights recruited you and offered unofficial Eagle Knight status if you managed to make it into the ranks of the colonists. There, you would see to the safety of the colony and send back reports with each supply ship regarding the general state of the colony and any threats you notice. The Bountiful Venture Company admired your military prowess and selected you for the second wave of colonists to arrive at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a breastplate, a longsword (or some other martial or simple weapon), and an additional 100 gp of gear. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Leveling</i> - If taken after level 1, the additional gp is 100 x lvl. In addition, if taken at level 3+, both the starting breastplate and weapon become masterwork at no additional cost; if taken at APL 7+, both the starting breastplate and weapon become +1 at no additional cost; if taken at level 11+, both the starting breastplate and weapon become +2 and are made from mithral; if taken at level 15+, the starting breatplate becomes a <i>+3 deathless mithral breastplate</i>, and the weapon becomes a <i>+3 seaborn mithral</i> weapon.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Grammel Taychar's support grants characters with this campaign trait the Favored Presige Class feat as a bonus feat.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Employee:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You have worked for the Bountiful Venture Company or you are the child of one of its current employees. This connection helped you get a leg up on the competition to get involved in the establishment of Talmandor’s Bounty. The company didn’t want nepotism to show through too strongly, so you weren’t included in the first wave of colonists and instead have been selected to accompany the second wave of colonists to the island. You don’t want people to know that you’re part of the company, but your contacts in the Bountiful Venture Company didn’t necessarily tell you that you needed to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with an additional 150 gp of equipment and know (at least in some capacity) one of the other company employees: Lyra Heatherly, Perrell Beys, or Ramona Avandth. Due to your association with the Bountiful Venture Company, your words and ideas may carry additional weight with the other employees of the company. (Your GM can grant a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks in regards to these people in certain situations.) In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always a class skill for you.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Leveling</i> - If taken after level 1, the amount of extra gp in equipment equals 150 x lvl x book number. So, a level 15 character in book 5 would start with an extra 11,250gp.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Ramona Advanth assigns a cohort to characters with this campaign trait, granting them Leadership as a bonus feat.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Expert Explorer:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Adventurous scholars raised you, or perhaps you were born during an expedition and haven’t known any other life. You get fidgety and impatient when you become too familiar with a certain place. You are used to having excitement and the quest for knowledge guides your path in life, and you picked up a number of skills along the way that relate to this lifestyle. During your interview with the Bountiful Venture Company, they were impressed with the diverse locations you’ve visited in your life and selected you because of your skills in maneuvering uncharted territory.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Knowledge skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus to check with that Knowledge skill and Survival checks, and either that Knowledge skill or Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you treat the machete as a simple weapon.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Lyra Heatherly assits the Expedition team in their explorations, granting characters with the Expert Explorer campaign trait Explorer and Weapon Focus (machete) - or a feat with Weapon Focus (machete) as a prerequisite which they otherwise qualify for - as bonus feats.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Following in the Footsteps:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - One of your dear friends or family members was part of the first wave of colonists to be selected by the Bountiful Venture Company to establish Talmandor’s Bounty. You applied for the first wave as well, but weren’t selected. Now that you’ve made your way into the second wave, you can’t wait to be reunited with your family member. Your devotion to your family or friends is important to you, and it shows not only in how you feel about that friend or family member you are soon to reunite with, but also in how you treat other people with respect.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Whenever you use the aid another action to aid an adjacent ally, increase the bonus you grant your ally by 1. In addition, due to your positive and helpful nature, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Kulena Sprads' friendly nature grants a +2 competence bonus on aid another attempts. In addition, chanracters with this trait also gain Skill Focus (Diplomacy) as a bonus feat.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Healthy:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You come from a long line of hale and long-lived people. Growing up, you rarely got sick and had enough energy to run all day if it suited you. You don’t get as tired as other people and repeated physical activities don’t seem to bother you much. You were selected as part of the expedition because the Bountiful Venture Company saw great importance and promise in your robust health.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, Swim checks to prevent nonlethal damage from fatigue after swimming for more than an hour at a time, and Constitution checks to prevent fatigue. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 times your Constitution score.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Father Eamon Caranth's words of inspiration from Old Deadeye further invigorate you, usually granting one or more benefits each time you succeed on a Fortitude saving throw against an effect: if the effect would have dealt damage, you gain 1 hp; if it would have caused fatigue, you instead gain a second wind, granting the benefits of <i>haste</i> for one round; if succeeding causes you to take a reduced negative effect, you instead ignore it; if the effect must be saved against each round, you gain a +2 bonus on subsequent saves against this instance of the effect (does not stack with itself).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Pathfinder Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Explore, report, and cooperate. This is the credo you’ve lived by since you’ve joined the Pathfinder Society, and after hearing about the expedition to found Talmandor’s Bounty you applied, eager to see the remains of Azlant. However, you quickly learned that the Bountiful Venture Company wasn’t interested in involving the Pathfinder Society in the formation of the colony. This struck you as strange, because who else has as keen an understanding of some of the elements of ancient Azlant as the Pathfinder Society? Regardless, you went through the application process, making sure to highlight all of your applicable skills and experience while keeping your involvement in the Society to yourself. You were elated to receive notice that you were selected for the second wave of colonists bound for the broken continent of Azlant.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a standard wayfinder and you gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Carver Hastings gifts each pathfinder recruit a single ioun stone of their choice woth 150 x lvl x book number or less. So, a level 15 character in book 5 would start with an ioun stone worth up to 11,250gp.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Resourcefull:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You’ve always had a knack for building and repairing things. As a kid, you always got into your parents’ tools and tinkered with things around the house. As you got older, you started making things not only to entertain yourself but also to take in a little extra money. People have noticed your skill and have frequently come to you to make something for them or to repair a pesky device or item. Every time you’ve amazed them at how quickly you do your work and how few resources you squander in the process. Likewise, the Bountiful Venture Company noticed your skill at not only creating wonderful wares, but also how effortlessly and efficiently you work in yourtrade. You always seem to make do with less, often in unexpected ways.</li> 
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Craft or Profession skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill. In addition, the time required for you to create a magic item is decreased. You require only 8 hours for every 1,500 gp in the item’s base price (instead of the normal 8 hours per 1,000 gp). You can create potions and scrolls whose base price is 375 gp in just 2 hours; potions and scrolls with a base price more than 375 gp but less than 1,500 gp take 8 hours to create, just like any other magic item.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Kereda Harper grants everyone Skill Focus in the skill chosen with this trait as a bonus feat.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Seasoned Hunter:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You grew up hunting every season, any season. Maybe you grew up in a rural area and hunted to put food on the table, or perhaps you come from a comfortable lifestyle where hunting for sport is an excellent excuse to camp in the wilderness and hone your skills. After sharing stories of your most exciting hunts and proving to them that you can hit a bull’s eye at 100 feet, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition assured that you can provide food and security to the young colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Pick one of the following creature types: aberration, animal, magical beast, or vermin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls or damage rolls (choose one; once chosen it can’t be changed) against creatures of that type.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Anya Sandstrider's woodcraft teaching grants characters with this campaign trait the Beast Hunter and Creature Focus bonus feats, or one of the feats Creature Focus can be substituted with for characters with the favored enemy class feature.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Set Mind:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Every time that you’ve said you’d do something, you’ve made sure to follow through. You can’t remember a time when you weren’t this way. People have a hard time making you change your mind once you’ve set yourself on a certain path. You might be exceptionally stubborn or you may just have a particular determination. Either way, you’re going to keep doing what you set your mind to. The Bountiful Venture Company recognized this useful trait of yours and selected you for the second wave of colonists because of your great resolve and unswerving dedication to what you set your mind upon.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect that would cause you to act differently than you normally would, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Father Kurvis Nurpico encourages and focus the stubborness of characters with this trait, granting Iron Will - or a feat with Iron Will as a prerequisite which they already qualify for - as a bonus feat.</li> -->
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Skillful:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You’ve always been interested in a wide array of things, and growing up you’ve spent time honing some of these talents, which has helped you in life. Some have attributed your successes to luck, but others have recognized what you truly have—skill. This interest in and practice of a diverse array of skills and abilities has served you well in a number of different jobs, and following in your varied interests you learned of the expedition to the ruins of Azlant. After your application, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition because your skillful approach to matters would be helpful for a growing colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail an Acrobatics, Climb, Spellcraft, Stealth, or Use Magic Device check, you can immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>
            <!-- <li style="display: none;"><i>Unlocked</i> - Carethet Maluis' increased access to quality equipment allows characters with this trait to use attempt up to three reroll's per day instead of one, though they may only use this ability once per day per skill.</li> -->

      <h2>Roleplaying a Sea Dweller on Land</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Role-Playing Tips:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Language:</b> Most aquatic creatures, particularly those who are nonamphibious, are used to talking underwater, where sound carries differently. As a result, they speak with rounded consonants and elongated vowel sounds. Some surfacers may mistake the accent as one from a different land region, while others don’t even notice the lilt to an aquatic speaker’s Common. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Volume:</b> Since sound and speech travel farther through water, aquatic creatures tend to talk in a lower, firmer tone in their native environment. This doesn’t always work in the air, and aquatic adventurers new to the surface may have a hard time making themselves heard. Land dwellers may accuse their aquatic companions of whispering or muttering. Some aquatic creatures tend to overcompensate for their habit of speaking quietly by shouting; locathahs, in particular, enjoy raising their voices to make themselves heard (though this is a benefit to surfacers who don’t like to get close to the fishy-smelling creatures anyway). After several weeks or months on land, however, most aquatic travelers learn to speak at a moderate volume. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Meeting Surface Dwellers:</b> Residents of coastal communities may have long experience interacting with aquatic creatures, while individuals farther inland may have never met aquatic creatures. Some adventurers, especially cecaelias and locathahs, enjoy being the first aquatic creature a person has ever seen. They happily engage with strangers, proudly displaying their anatomy (in whatever manner they deem socially appropriate, of course) and discussing their life under the sea. Tritons generally don’t mind conversing with surfacers, but they aren’t prone to idle chatter the way cecaelias and locathahs can be.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Disguises:</b> Some aquatic creatures are more reluctant to stand out. Aquatic elves, gillmen, and merfolk all value their privacy and are suspicious of surface dwellers. For aquatic elves and gillmen, it’s relatively easy to take on the appearance of a surface race. Merfolk and members of monstrous races have a more difficult time concealing their appearances. However, aquatic creatures with humanoid torsos and facial shapes — even merfolk — can make good use of mundane disguises. A long robe or gown can conceal a finned tail, a hood or wide-brimmed hat can shade facial features, and a scarf can obscure gills on the neck. Locathahs and cecaelias have trouble disguising themselves as land dwellers; cecaelias’ tentacles are too bulky to easily conceal, and locathahs emit an unmistakable fishy odor. Nonetheless, spells and magic items can bolster any aquatic adventurer’s disguise; alter self and disguise self are the most common spells, and a hat of disguise is relatively cheap (although note that cecaelias and tritons are monstrous humanoids and outsiders, respectively, so they can’t use disguise self to pass themselves off as humanoids).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Paradox of Boots:</b> Aquatic adventurers lacking legs and feet often seek out magic items to help them move when traveling on land. However, most magic items that enhance movement are boots; an adventurer may find the perfect magic item to help them is one they cannot wear.Some aquatic races have feet (or something similar enough) to be able to wear boots. Aquatic elves, gillmen, locathahs, sahuagin, and tritons can wear boots normally. Cecaelias and grindylows can use magic boots by fitting each one over a tentacle (even if it looks a somewhat ridiculous).Adaros and merfolk do not have a boots magic item slot, so they cannot wear magic boots without some form of transmutation magic to first give them legs. If a legless creature polymorphed into a form with legs is wearing magic boots when the spell ends, the boots appear on the ground next to the wearer; neither the boots nor the wearer take damage from the transformation.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Prejudice and Adoration:</b> Disguises are a matter of privacy, but also one of safety. Some communities fear or hate aquatic creatures, even if they are initially welcoming. A coastal village raided by sahuagin might, for example, come to believe all sea dwelling creatures are monsters and spies. An aquatic adventurer entering these communities could be arrested or attacked on the flimsiest pretense. Meanwhile, other settlements may  embrace them. Tales of the beauty and talent of merfolk, for example,  are common along coastlines, and villagers may gather to gaze in wonder at a merfolk traveling on land. Besotted surfacers may beg for a strand of an aquatic adventurer’s hair, a scale shed from her tail, or a song to carry in their memory. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Materials:</b> Salt water is incredibly harsh; sea dwellers often rely on coral, eel skin, shells, stone, woven kelp, and similar materials, and might be surprised to learn that such materials aren’t in common use on the surface. Conversely, a sea dweller might be unfamiliar with materials common on the surface, such as leather, paper, wood, and textiles such as cotton. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Gravity:</b> Sea dwellers may be unaccustomed to the pull of dry land. At first, these adventurers might rely on buoyancy that no longer exists, often tripping, falling, or even having difficulty lying down. Others may overestimate their ability to jump, leaping blithely off rooftops or into gullies without properly gauging the distance. Most aquatic explorers end their first week on land covered with bruises. Just as it can be difficult for land walkers to think in the three dimensions of undersea travel, it can be hard for aquatic adventurers to learn that three-dimensional movement isn’t easy on land, and that going around a structure, or using stairs or a ramp to descend from a high surface, is inconvenient but necessary. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Sleep:</b> Sea dwellers may also have trouble sleeping. Aquatic species tend to rest floating upright, so lying down can feel unnatural. Insomnia commonly plagues aquatic adventurers when they venture on land, and they may develop elaborate rituals to ensure a good night’s sleep, such as insisting on cold temperatures and complete darkness. Some may dampen their bedroll with water, taking comfort in the cool and clammy feel of the fabric.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Heat:</b> In most climates, the air is warmer than the sea. Sea dwellers may be used to the cold, but might not be prepared for consistently dry and hot climates outside of the water. Apart from being unpleasantly warm for them, dry climates can cause their skin to crack and flake away, which aquatic races find exceedingly uncomfortable. Pale-skinned aquatic races may have never experienced a sunburn, so they may be unprepared for how quickly skin can redden and burn when constantly exposed to the sun.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Weather:</b> Surface weather can seem unusual to sea dwellers; the ocean experiences weather of a sort, but shifting undersea currents are unlike surface winds, and cyclones are very different underwater than they are on land. Undersea creatures that have lived near the surface might be familiar with rain, thunder, lightning, and wind, but other weather phenomena such as sandstorms, snow, or tornadoes may surprise them. Aquatic races might lack the basic instincts to protect themselves from a lightning strike or a blizzard, simply because they haven’t experienced them before.Conversely, aquatic adventurers are particularly sensitive to unseen movements in their environment, due to operating in dim or murky water for most of their lives. Surfacers might be surprised to find an aquatic companion seeming to “read” a change in the wind or perceiving an oncoming storm much sooner than they themselves can see the signs.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Fire:</b> Of all the strange new phenomena aquatic adventurers face on land, the most common and the most dangerous may be fire. Aquatic adventurers may have never encountered it before. Even magical fire often fails to burn underwater, so while sea dwellers may have heard about fire, but never really experienced it. They rarely seriously burn themselves, as the heat of the flames warns flesh away long before it burns, but common fire care or safety, however, may escape them. It might be difficult or impossible for an sea dweller to light a torch or start a stable campfire.If unsupervised, characters could inadvertently build a fire in a dry, brushy area without clearing a safe space first, build blazingly hot fires with smoke visible for miles, or they might select materials that look flammable but don’t burn well (such as wool or wet wood). </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Cooking:</b> Cooked food is a novelty for most sea dwellers. Some find cooked food unappetizing, declaring it tough and smoky compared to crisp sea vegetables and fresh fish, and they insist on eating food (including meat) raw. Others enjoy the new flavors of cooked food, perhaps even learning to prepare hot meals themselves. Locathahs especially adore surface cuisine.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Clothing:</b> One of the biggest cultural differences between land and sea dwellers is the latter rarely wear clothes. Fabric disintegrates quickly underwater and hampers efficient swimming. Many aquatic creatures have learned to read currents, temperature, and water conditions by the feel of water moving across their bare skin as they swim, so they find that clothing dulls their senses. At most, aquatic creatures operating under the sea tend to wear leather or silk harnesses on their upper bodies and shorts or a loincloth if they have legs. While some races, such as aquatic elves, may boast more developed fashions, few other races are used to wearing clothing to the extent common on the surface.Aquatic adventurers traveling on land often wear as little as possible and prefer loose, light fabrics. Robes and skirts are popular among aquatic adventurers of all genders for the freedom of movement they offer. Even after they learn the extent of propriety in public, aquatic adventurers lose no time stripping out of confining clothes in private.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Wonder:</b> While surface environments may be strange, they can also be incredibly beautiful. Some adventurers fall in love with surface cultures and return whenever they can. Though sea and land dwellers come from starkly different worlds, they can eventually learn to appreciate and even feel at home in each other’s environments.</li>

      <h2>Roleplaying a Land Dweller Under the Sea</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Role-Playing Tips:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Language:</b> Undersea communities are foreign lands in that surface dwellers rarely know the customs or language and often look dreadfully out of place. The Aquan language serves the same role among undersea races as Common does on land—providing a single language that creatures of many types can use to communicate. Aquan is particularly easy to pronounce with a mouthful of water, whereas Common words with harsh sounds can be difficult to speak underwater without a hard-edged surfacer accent.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Disguises:</b> Magical disguises, including disguises provided by a hat of disguise or the spells alter self or disguise self, are useful for fitting in underwater. Mundane disguises, however, are much harder to pull off. Most aquatic races wear very little in the way of clothing, and voluminous robes or cloaks seem suspiciously hindering and out of place. Even a skilled disguise artist can’t make a human look like a locathah without significant difficulty. A surfacer trying to fit in underwater is best served by mimicking the closest aquatic analogue. For example, humans can impersonate gillmen with the addition of fake gills and violet eye lenses, and surface elves can impersonate their aquatic kin with fake webbing between their fingers and toes.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Prejudice:</b> Disguises may be difficult to create underwater, but they can be incredibly important. Many aquatic races, particularly aquatic elves and merfolk, are startlingly xenophobic and refuse to admit outsiders. Even in cosmopolitan settlements, such as the city of Talasantri, surface adventurers draw a lot of attention. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Enviornment:</b> Many adventurers from the surface feel claustrophobic underwater. Unless an adventurer stays in the upper reaches of the ocean where light is abundant, being underwater can feel like being in an unendingly vast, dark cave. Surfacers can also find constant submersion uncomfortable. Fear and adrenaline may make it hard to sleep. Skin becomes damp and swollen, clothing ill suited for immersion can chafe or irritate, and surface travelers often feel cold even at very shallow depths. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Navigation:</b> Moving in three dimensions is usually a foreign concept to surfacers, and they are often stymied by trying to go around an obstacle rather than instinctively going above or under it. Surfacers also lack practice in reading currents to establish direction, and aquatic races can grow frustrated when surfacers don’t recognize the significance of a coral growth or an undersea vent. When this lack of experience is coupled with the common inability to see very far underwater, explorers from the surface often get lost without a reliable underwater guide or a tool such as an underwater compass. Eventually, through practice and prolonged submersion, most surfacers get the knack for underwater navigation.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Wonder:</b> While aquatic environments may be strange, they can also be incredibly beautiful. Some adventurers fall in love with underwater cultures and return whenever they can. Though sea and land dwellers come from starkly different worlds, they can eventually learn to appreciate and even feel at home in each other’s environments.</li>

      <h2>Azlanti Archeology</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Click to Show/Hide information about Azlanti Archeology:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Age of Legends:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Knowledge History)</i> The Empire of Azlant was the first human empire, with Thassilon begining as a colony of exiles from Azlant, and predating the then-fledgling Kalesh, Jade, and Osirion empires. The defeat of the Sepentfolk by the Empire of Azlant ushered in the Age of Legends, which lasted 1200 years, and the destruction of Azlant ushered in the Age of Darkness, which began over 10,000 years ago.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Language:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Linguistics)</i> The language of Azlant was Azlanti. Other languages that existed at the time were Elven, Giant, the Planar Languages (like Aquan or Celestial) and the azlanti-variant Thassilonian. A few long-lived species (such as dragons) have also preserved their language enough from the Age of Legends. Common was not established until the founding and spread of Taldor, over 2,000 years after the destruction of Azlant.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Magic:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Spellcraft)</i> The Empire of Azlant infused magic into everything. Their magic was strong enough to terraform their enviornment, genetically enhance their people, and keep many of their devices still functioning in their ruins, despite their age. Even small, seemingly common household-items can have wonderous functions that are priceless in both monetary, historical, and welfare perspectives. The Azlanti humans were more highly developed than mankind is now, every Azlanti was capable of at least minor magic, and many of our most powerful magical creations today would be considered paltry to their society.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Ruins:</b> <i>(Recommended Skills - Adventuring Standbys) Azlant was destroyed in the great cataclism of Earthfall, where the Starstone fell to earth. The impact shattered the continent of Arcadia and sank most of it beneath the ocean, it killing several Gods and cutting off the Azlanti from their dieties, and it filled the sky with smoke and ash that took roughly 1,000 years before it cleared. By the time the sun shone on the land of Golarion again, the ecology of the planet was drastically changed, with most of the survivors living underwater or underground. The islands in the Arcadian Ocean above the continent of Azlant used to be mountain peaks, and most of the remaining ruins are underwater and/or burried in millenia of foliage and erosion.</i> </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Societies:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Diplomacy) The islands of Arcadia, such as Ancorato (where Talmandor's Bounty is being founded), have been visited only rarely due to the difficulty in navigating there, and has never been successfully colonized, despite previous attempts. Many creatures living in and around the continent are different from those living in Avistan or around the Inner Sea - even the Elves are unique, as they were ancient rivals to (and completely outmatched by) Azlant and view it as their duty to protect the secrets of the continent to maintain stability for their people. Developing peaceful trade relations with as many of these foreign cultures as possible is essential to surviving in Arcadia.</i> </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Technology:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Craft Clockwork)</i> Azlant believed in the fusing of technology and magic, creating and innovating tools so that every citizen of Azlant had the benefits of magic greater than many of the most magnificent accomplishments today. A great deal of their technology survives to this day, and those artifacts can be priceless. Most of Azlanti technology is powered by ioun stones, magical stones of their invention. A great deal of azlanti technology was constructed using clockwork mechanisms and engineering.</li>

      <h2>Ruins of Azlant: Climate and Geography of Arcadia</h2>
    <section>
      <img src="images/map-azlant-sketch-extra.jpg" alt="Map of Azlant">
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>The region mapped here is only the eastern edge of the shattered continent. After sailing for 1,000 miles due west from Mediogalti Isle, this is the first region one comes across. At roughly 30° N latitude, Ancorato and nearby islands have a humid subtropical climate. </p>
      <p>While temperatures in the region can reach 100° F, for the most part the temperature ranges from the low 70s to the high 90s. The air is humid, and when it’s hot, it often feels like every breath is forcibly swallowed rather than comfortably inhaled. The temperature in the region rarely drops below freezing, and when it does, it’s only for a few hours during the night. While generally wet—as daily rain showers sprinkle the region in the afternoons for periods of time lasting from 20 minutes to an hour a day—the region sees a potential for violent storms, especially in the late-summer to late-fall months. Winters tend to be dry.</p>
      <p>This part of the former Azlanti continent was a largely hilly and mountainous region that had the wide and ancient Kelveth River flowing through it. This region was situated roughly 60 miles inland from the eastern shore of lost Azlant, where the rolling hills gradually fell to grassy wetlands before reaching the coast. </p>
      <p>Today, the shattered remnants of the highest peaks in the region are the only things that remain above water, weathered by time and forever changed. These islands rise sharply out of the Arcadian Ocean, and their beaches are as likely to be rocky as they are to have thin sandy strips ringing them. The islands sport numerous bays and coves suitable for landing many types of ships, but deep bays capable of allowing large vessels to dock right up to land are rare. </p>
      <p>The waters surrounding these islands are not as deep as those in other parts of the Arcadian Ocean, reaching only a few hundred feet at the deepest. Farther away from this region, the seafloor drops a few thousand feet. </p>
      <p>The islands here support a rich ecology. Thousands of species of birds, insects, mammals, and reptiles make their homes here, and cephalopods, crustaceans, and fish swim in the surrounding waters in great numbers.</p>
      <p>While some palm trees grow along the shores of the islands, the vast majority of plant life is inland, where forests of pines as well as deciduous trees such as oaks span the rolling landscape. Palmettos and shrubs cover the forest floors where light penetrates in warm beams through the humid air, and some islands boast dense mangrove forests along their coasts. Tangled clumps of moss dangle from the sprawling branches of ancient oaks, and the smell of pine sap hangs in the air during warm months alongside the buzz of insects.</p>
      <p>Numerous fruiting trees grow in the region, providing the inhabitants of the islands access to well-rounded nutrition, with the area around Talmandor's bounty sharing space with magnolia, palmetto, pecan, mango, and papaya trees in abundance. An individual can readily forage enough to survive for a day, even in the coldest of months — the only thing lacking would be variety.</p>
      <p>Although the soil in some parts of the region is hostile to farming, the majority of the islands can support agriculture. The biggest challenges in farming in this region are areas of rocky soil that are difficult to plow and places where the elevation makes large-plot farming more labor intensive than usual. The climate allows for a long growing season, and most foods, other than fresh fruits and vegetables, can be stored in cellars for the long term.</p>
      <p>Despite generally favorable conditions, unexpected exceptions arise due to remnants of strange Azlanti magic, unconventional migrations, or leftovers from previous visits to the region by far-flung travelers. This area has had 10,000 years in which to redevelop its ecology—plenty of time for new inhabitants to rise up, fall into decline, completely die out, and be replaced by something else.</p>
