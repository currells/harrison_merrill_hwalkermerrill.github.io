        <li style="display: none;"><b>Citizenship:</b> All characters are Andoran Citizens (though they may be from elsewhere), and are treated as free and equal in all rights and privileges with respect to the law. Andoran does not have a nobility caste or slavery, and all slaves brought to Andoran are considered free.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Currency:</b> Andoran uses copper caps, silver wolves, gold sails, and platinum falcons, though they refer to all coins by these names and use them interchangably, regardless of mint origin.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Langauges:</b> As a former Taldan Province, the official language of Andoran is Common. Recommended languages include: Aboleth, Aquan, Azlanti, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Sylvan, Syrinx, Thassilonian, and Undercommon. Other useful languages include: Abyssal, Aklo, Auran, Boggard, Celestial, Cyclops, Dark Folk, Draconic, Ghol-Gan, Infernal, Orvian, Polyglot, and Sahuagin. Common regional dialects include: Shoanti, Varisian, and Vudrani.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Origins:</b> While most players should be natural born citizens of Andoran, as an egalitarian country, Andoran is filled with immigrants from all over Avistan and other parts of Golarion.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Racism:</b> Andoran prides itself on being welcoming and open, though many still regard monstrous humanoids and native outsiders, especially tieflings due to their proximity with Cheliax, with suspicion and occasional hatred.</li>

      <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Trait Options: Players must choose ONE of these traits upon character creation; no two players may share campaign traits:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Athletic:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You have always had a knack for physical activity. You either grew up in a rural area and had an active childhood where you were always climbing trees, swimming in lakes and rivers, and clambering up rocky hillsides, or you competed in and excelled at contests or sports while growing up in a larger settlement. Due to this background, little can slow you down or inhibit your movements. When the Bountiful Venture Company interviewed you, they noticed your stature and physicality, and they chose you for the colonial expedition knowing that a strong back is always helpful in a growing colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You reduce your armor check penalty by a number equal to one-third your character level (minimum 1) for purposes of Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to one of these three skills, chosen when you take this trait.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Azlanti Scholar:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You are familiar with an aspect of Azlanti lore. Maybe you first became enamored with this ancient culture after stumbling across a copy of the first volume of the Pathfinder Chronicles or after learning about Azlant in a university or another type of formal education. Perhaps your parents or guardians were scholars and you’ve grown up hearing about and reading about the ancient Azlanti. For years you dreamed about visiting the continent’s ruins and returning with a discovery that could propel your career. Due to this scholarly bent, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you to join the colony at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Use Magic Device checks, and one of these skills is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain Azlanti as a bonus language.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Eagle Knight Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> -  Since Talmandor’s Bounty is an Andoren colony and is unlikely to see the threat of slavery, the presence of the Eagle Knights isn’t strongly needed, and the Bountiful Venture Company would prefer to not have that organization immediately associated with the colony (despite the colony’s name having been derived from the Eagle Knights’ patron, Talmandor). However, the need for safety can’t be overlooked. You were a soldier in the Andoren army or you were a civilian who showed great promise in military matters. The Eagle Knights recruited you and offered unofficial Eagle Knight status if you managed to make it into the ranks of the colonists. There, you would see to the safety of the colony and send back reports with each supply ship regarding the general state of the colony and any threats you notice. The Bountiful Venture Company admired your military prowess and selected you for the second wave of colonists to arrive at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a breastplate, a longsword (or some other martial or simple weapon), and an additional 100 gp of gear. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Employee:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You have worked for the Bountiful Venture Company or you are the child of one of its current employees. This connection helped you get a leg up on the competition to get involved in the establishment of Talmandor’s Bounty. The company didn’t want nepotism to show through too strongly, so you weren’t included in the first wave of colonists and instead have been selected to accompany the second wave of colonists to the island. You don’t want people to know that you’re part of the company, but your contacts in the Bountiful Venture Company didn’t necessarily tell you that you needed to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with an additional 150 gp of equipment and know (at least in some capacity) one of the other company employees: Lyra Heatherly, Perrell Beys, or Ramona Avandth. Due to your association with the Bountiful Venture Company, your words and ideas may carry additional weight with the other employees of the company. (Your GM can grant a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks in regards to these people in certain situations.) In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always a class skill for you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Expert Explorer:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Adventurous scholars raised you, or perhaps you were born during an expedition and haven’t known any other life. You get fidgety and impatient when you become too familiar with a certain place. You are used to having excitement and the quest for knowledge guides your path in life, and you picked up a number of skills along the way that relate to this lifestyle. During your interview with the Bountiful Venture Company, they were impressed with the diverse locations you’ve visited in your life and selected you because of your skills in maneuvering uncharted territory.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Knowledge skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus to check with that Knowledge skill and Survival checks, and either that Knowledge skill or Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you treat the machete as a simple weapon.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Following in the Footsteps:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - One of your dear friends or family members was part of the first wave of colonists to be selected by the Bountiful Venture Company to establish Talmandor’s Bounty. You applied for the first wave as well, but weren’t selected. Now that you’ve made your way into the second wave, you can’t wait to be reunited with your family member. Your devotion to your family or friends is important to you, and it shows not only in how you feel about that friend or family member you are soon to reunite with, but also in how you treat other people with respect.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Whenever you use the aid another action to aid an adjacent ally, increase the bonus you grant your ally by 1. In addition, due to your positive and helpful nature, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Healthy:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You come from a long line of hale and long-lived people. Growing up, you rarely got sick and had enough energy to run all day if it suited you. You don’t get as tired as other people and repeated physical activities don’t seem to bother you much. You were selected as part of the expedition because the Bountiful Venture Company saw great importance and promise in your robust health.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, Swim checks to prevent nonlethal damage from fatigue after swimming for more than an hour at a time, and Constitution checks to prevent fatigue. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 times your Constitution score.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Pathfinder Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Explore, report, and cooperate. This is the credo you’ve lived by since you’ve joined the Pathfinder Society, and after hearing about the expedition to found Talmandor’s Bounty you applied, eager to see the remains of Azlant. However, you quickly learned that the Bountiful Venture Company wasn’t interested in involving the Pathfinder Society in the formation of the colony. This struck you as strange, because who else has as keen an understanding of some of the elements of ancient Azlant as the Pathfinder Society? Regardless, you went through the application process, making sure to highlight all of your applicable skills and experience while keeping your involvement in the Society to yourself. You were elated to receive notice that you were selected for the second wave of colonists bound for the broken continent of Azlant.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a standard wayfinder and you gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Resourcefull:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You’ve always had a knack for building and repairing things. As a kid, you always got into your parents’ tools and tinkered with things around the house. As you got older, you started making things not only to entertain yourself but also to take in a little extra money. People have noticed your skill and have frequently come to you to make something for them or to repair a pesky device or item. Every time you’ve amazed them at how quickly you do your work and how few resources you squander in the process. Likewise, the Bountiful Venture Company noticed your skill at not only creating wonderful wares, but also how effortlessly and efficiently you work in yourtrade. You always seem to make do with less, often in unexpected ways.</li> 
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Craft or Profession skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill. In addition, the time required for you to create a magic item is decreased. You require only 8 hours for every 1,500 gp in the item’s base price (instead of the normal 8 hours per 1,000 gp). You can create potions and scrolls whose base price is 375 gp in just 2 hours; potions and scrolls with a base price more than 375 gp but less than 1,500 gp take 8 hours to create, just like any other magic item.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Seasoned Hunter:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You grew up hunting every season, any season. Maybe you grew up in a rural area and hunted to put food on the table, or perhaps you come from a comfortable lifestyle where hunting for sport is an excellent excuse to camp in the wilderness and hone your skills. After sharing stories of your most exciting hunts and proving to them that you can hit a bull’s eye at 100 feet, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition assured that you can provide food and security to the young colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Pick one of the following creature types: aberration, animal, magical beast, or vermin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls or damage rolls (choose one; once chosen it can’t be changed) against creatures of that type.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Set Mind:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - Every time that you’ve said you’d do something, you’ve made sure to follow through. You can’t remember a time when you weren’t this way. People have a hard time making you change your mind once you’ve set yourself on a certain path. You might be exceptionally stubborn or you may just have a particular determination. Either way, you’re going to keep doing what you set your mind to. The Bountiful Venture Company recognized this useful trait of yours and selected you for the second wave of colonists because of your great resolve and unswerving dedication to what you set your mind upon.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect that would cause you to act differently than you normally would, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Skillful:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Background</i> - You’ve always been interested in a wide array of things, and growing up you’ve spent time honing some of these talents, which has helped you in life. Some have attributed your successes to luck, but others have recognized what you truly have—skill. This interest in and practice of a diverse array of skills and abilities has served you well in a number of different jobs, and following in your varied interests you learned of the expedition to the ruins of Azlant. After your application, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition because your skillful approach to matters would be helpful for a growing colony.</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail an Acrobatics, Climb, Spellcraft, Stealth, or Use Magic Device check, you can immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>

      <h2>Azlanti Archeology</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><b>Click to Show/Hide information about Azlanti Archeology:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Age of Legends:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Knowledge History)</i> The Empire of Azlant was the first human empire, with Thassilon begining as a colony of exiles from Azlant, and predating the then-fledgling Kalesh, Jade, and Ossirion empires. The defeat of the Sepentfolk by the Empire of Azlant ushered in the Age of Legends, which lasted 1200 years, and the destruction of Azlant ushered in the Age of Darkness, which began over 10,000 years ago.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Language:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Linguistics)</i> The language of Azlant was Azlanti. Other languages that existed at the time were Elven, Giant, the Planar Languages (like Aquan or Celestial) and the azlanti-variant Thassilonian. A few long-lived species (such as dragons) have also preserved their language enough from the Age of Legends. Common was not established until the founding and spread of Taldor, over 2,000 years after the destruction of Azlant.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Magic:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Spellcraft)</i> The Empire of Azlant infused magic into everything. Their magic was strong enough to terraform their enviornment, genetically enhance their people, and keep many of their devices still functioning in their ruins, despite their age. Even small, seemingly common household-items can have wonderous functions that are priceless in both monetary, historical, and welfare perspectives. The Azlanti humans were more highly developed than mankind is now, every Azlanti was capable of at least minor magic, and many of our most powerful magical creations today would be considered paltry to their society.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Ruins:</b> <i>(Recommended Skills - Adventuring Standbys) Azlant was destroyed in the great cataclism of Earthfall, where the Starstone fell to earth. The impact shattered the continent of Arcadia and sank most of it beneath the ocean, it killing several Gods and cutting off the Azlanti from their dieties, and it filled the sky with smoke and ash that took roughly 1,000 years before it cleared. By the time the sun shone on the land of Golarion again, the ecology of the planet was drastically changed, with most of the survivors living underwater or underground. The islands in the Arcadian Ocean above the continent of Azlant used to be mountain peaks, and most of the remaining ruins are underwater and/or burried in millenia of foliage and erosion.</i> </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Societies:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Diplomacy) The islands of Arcadia, such as Ancorato (where Talmandor's Bounty is being founded), have been visited only rarely due to the difficulty in navigating there, and has never been successfully colonized, despite previous attempts. Many creatures living in and around the continent are different from those living in Avistan or around the Inner Sea - even the Elves are unique, as they were ancient rivals to (and completely outmatched by) Azlant and view it as their duty to protect the secrets of the continent to maintain stability for their people. Developing peaceful trade relations with as many of these foreign cultures as possible is essential to surviving in Arcadia.</i> </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Technology:</b> <i>(Recommended Skill - Craft Clockwork)</i> Azlant believed in the fusing of technology and magic, creating and innovating tools so that every citizen of Azlant had the benefits of magic greater than many of the most magnificent accomplishments today. A great deal of their technology survives to this day, and those artifacts can be priceless. Most of Azlanti technology is powered by ioun stones, magical stones of their invention. A great deal of azlanti technology was constructed using clockwork mechanisms and engineering.</li>

      <p>The region mapped here is only the eastern edge of the shattered continent. After sailing for 1,000 miles due west from Mediogalti Isle, this is the first region one comes across. At roughly 30° N latitude, Ancorato and nearby islands have a humid subtropical climate. </p>
      <p>While temperatures in the region can reach 100° F, for the most part the temperature ranges from the low 70s to the high 90s. The air is humid, and when it’s hot, it often feels like every breath is forcibly swallowed rather than comfortably inhaled. The temperature in the region rarely drops below freezing, and when it does, it’s only for a few hours during the night. While generally wet—as daily rain showers sprinkle the region in the afternoons for periods of time lasting from 20 minutes to an hour a day—the region sees a potential for violent storms, especially in the late-summer to late-fall months. Winters tend to be dry.</p>
      <p>This part of the former Azlanti continent was a largely hilly and mountainous region that had the wide and ancient Kelveth River flowing through it. This region was situated roughly 60 miles inland from the eastern shore of lost Azlant, where the rolling hills gradually fell to grassy wetlands before reaching the coast. </p>
      <p>Today, the shattered remnants of the highest peaks in the region are the only things that remain above water, weathered by time and forever changed. These islands rise sharply out of the Arcadian Ocean, and their beaches are as likely to be rocky as they are to have thin sandy strips ringing them. The islands sport numerous bays and coves suitable for landing many types of ships, but deep bays capable of allowing large vessels to dock right up to land are rare. </p>
      <p>The waters surrounding these islands are not as deep as those in other parts of the Arcadian Ocean, reaching only a few hundred feet at the deepest. Farther away from this region, the seafloor drops a few thousand feet. </p>
      <p>The islands here support a rich ecology. Thousands of species of birds, insects, mammals, and reptiles make their homes here, and cephalopods, crustaceans, and fish swim in the surrounding waters in great numbers.</p>
      <p>While some palm trees grow along the shores of the islands, the vast majority of plant life is inland, where forests of pines as well as deciduous trees such as oaks span the rolling landscape. Palmettos and shrubs cover the forest floors where light penetrates in warm beams through the humid air, and some islands boast dense mangrove forests along their coasts. Tangled clumps of moss dangle from the sprawling branches of ancient oaks, and the smell of pine sap hangs in the air during warm months alongside the buzz of insects.</p>
      <p>Numerous fruiting trees grow in the region, providing the inhabitants of the islands access to well-rounded nutrition. An individual can readily forage enough to survive for a day, even in the coldest of months—the only thing lacking would be variety.</p>
      <p>Although the soil in some parts of the region is hostile to farming, the majority of the islands can support agriculture. The biggest challenges in farming in this region are areas of rocky soil that are difficult to plow and places where the elevation makes large-plot farming more labor intensive than usual. The climate allows for a long growing season, and most foods, other than fresh fruits and vegetables, can be stored in cellars for the long term.</p>
      <p>Despite generally favorable conditions, unexpected exceptions arise due to remnants of strange Azlanti magic, unconventional migrations, or leftovers from previous visits to the region by far-flung travelers. This area has had 10,000 years in which to redevelop its ecology—plenty of time for new inhabitants to rise up, fall into decline, completely die out, and be replaced by something else.</p>
