      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Campaign and Character Details:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Citizenship:</b> All characters are Andoran Citizens (though they may be from elsewhere), and are treated as free and equal in all rights and privileges with respect to the law. Andoran does not have a nobility caste or slavery, and all slaves brought to Andoran are considered free.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Currency:</b> Andoran uses copper caps, silver wolves, gold sails, and platinum falcons, though they refer to all coins by these names and use them interchangably, regardless of mint origin.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Langauges:</b> As a former Taldan Province, the official language of Andoran is Common. Recommended languages include: Aboleth, Aquan, Azlanti, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Sylvan, Syrinx, Thassilonian, and Undercommon. Other useful languages include: Abyssal, Aklo, Auran, Boggard, Celestial, Cyclops, Dark Folk, Draconic, Ghol-Gan, Infernal, Orvian, Polyglot, and Sahuagin. Common regional dialects include: Shoanti, Varisian, and Vudrani.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Origins:</b> While most players should be natural born citizens of Andoran, as an egalitarian country, Andoran is filled with immigrants from all over Avistan and other parts of Golarion.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Racism:</b> Andoran prides itself on being welcoming and open, though many still regard monstrous humanoids and native outsiders, especially tieflings due to their proximity with Cheliax, with suspicion and occasional hatred.</li>

      <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Trait Options: Players must choose ONE of these traits upon character creation:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Athletic:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You have always had a knack for physical activity. You either grew up in a rural area and had an active childhood where you were always climbing trees, swimming in lakes and rivers, and clambering up rocky hillsides, or you competed in and excelled at contests or sports while growing up in a larger settlement. Due to this background, little can slow you down or inhibit your movements. When the Bountiful Venture Company interviewed you, they noticed your stature and physicality, and they chose you for the colonial expedition knowing that a strong back is always helpful in a growing colony.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You reduce your armor check penalty by a number equal to one-third your character level (minimum 1) for purposes of Acrobatics, Climb, and Swim checks, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to one of these three skills, chosen when you take this trait.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Azlanti Scholar:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You are familiar with an aspect of Azlanti lore. Maybe you first became enamored with this ancient culture after stumbling across a copy of the first volume of the Pathfinder Chronicles or after learning about Azlant in a university or another type of formal education. Perhaps your parents or guardians were scholars and you’ve grown up hearing about and reading about the ancient Azlanti. For years you dreamed about visiting the continent’s ruins and returning with a discovery that could propel your career. Due to this scholarly bent, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you to join the colony at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), and Use Magic Device checks, and one of these skills is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain Azlanti as a bonus language.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Eagle Knight Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> -  Since Talmandor’s Bounty is an Andoren colony and is unlikely to see the threat of slavery, the presence of the Eagle Knights isn’t strongly needed, and the Bountiful Venture Company would prefer to not have that organization immediately associated with the colony (despite the colony’s name having been derived from the Eagle Knights’ patron, Talmandor). However, the need for safety can’t be overlooked. You were a soldier in the Andoren army or you were a civilian who showed great promise in military matters. The Eagle Knights recruited you and offered unofficial Eagle Knight status if you managed to make it into the ranks of the colonists. There, you would see to the safety of the colony and send back reports with each supply ship regarding the general state of the colony and any threats you notice. The Bountiful Venture Company admired your military prowess and selected you for the second wave of colonists to arrive at Talmandor’s Bounty.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a breastplate, a longsword (or some other martial or simple weapon), and an additional 100 gp of gear. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Employee:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You have worked for the Bountiful Venture Company or you are the child of one of its current employees. This connection helped you get a leg up on the competition to get involved in the establishment of Talmandor’s Bounty. The company didn’t want nepotism to show through too strongly, so you weren’t included in the first wave of colonists and instead have been selected to accompany the second wave of colonists to the island. You don’t want people to know that you’re part of the company, but your contacts in the Bountiful Venture Company didn’t necessarily tell you that you needed to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with an additional 150 gp of equipment and know (at least in some capacity) one of the other company employees: Lyra Heatherly, Perrell Beys, or Ramona Avandth. Due to your association with the Bountiful Venture Company, your words and ideas may carry additional weight with the other employees of the company. (Your GM can grant a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks in regards to these people in certain situations.) In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always a class skill for you.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Expert Explorer:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - Adventurous scholars raised you, or perhaps you were born during an expedition and haven’t known any other life. You get fidgety and impatient when you become too familiar with a certain place. You are used to having excitement and the quest for knowledge guides your path in life, and you picked up a number of skills along the way that relate to this lifestyle. During your interview with the Bountiful Venture Company, they were impressed with the diverse locations you’ve visited in your life and selected you because of your skills in maneuvering uncharted territory.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Knowledge skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus to check with that Knowledge skill and Survival checks, and either that Knowledge skill or Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you treat the machete as a simple weapon.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Following in the Footsteps:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - One of your dear friends or family members was part of the first wave of colonists to be selected by the Bountiful Venture Company to establish Talmandor’s Bounty. You applied for the first wave as well, but weren’t selected. Now that you’ve made your way into the second wave, you can’t wait to be reunited with your family member. Your devotion to your family or friends is important to you, and it shows not only in how you feel about that friend or family member you are soon to reunite with, but also in how you treat other people with respect.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Whenever you use the aid another action to aid an adjacent ally, increase the bonus you grant your ally by 1. In addition, due to your positive and helpful nature, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Healthy:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You come from a long line of hale and long-lived people. Growing up, you rarely got sick and had enough energy to run all day if it suited you. You don’t get as tired as other people and repeated physical activities don’t seem to bother you much. You were selected as part of the expedition because the Bountiful Venture Company saw great importance and promise in your robust health.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, Swim checks to prevent nonlethal damage from fatigue after swimming for more than an hour at a time, and Constitution checks to prevent fatigue. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 times your Constitution score.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Pathfinder Recruit:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - Explore, report, and cooperate. This is the credo you’ve lived by since you’ve joined the Pathfinder Society, and after hearing about the expedition to found Talmandor’s Bounty you applied, eager to see the remains of Azlant. However, you quickly learned that the Bountiful Venture Company wasn’t interested in involving the Pathfinder Society in the formation of the colony. This struck you as strange, because who else has as keen an understanding of some of the elements of ancient Azlant as the Pathfinder Society? Regardless, you went through the application process, making sure to highlight all of your applicable skills and experience while keeping your involvement in the Society to yourself. You were elated to receive notice that you were selected for the second wave of colonists bound for the broken continent of Azlant.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - You begin play with a standard wayfinder and you gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Resourcefull:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You’ve always had a knack for building and repairing things. As a kid, you always got into your parents’ tools and tinkered with things around the house. As you got older, you started making things not only to entertain yourself but also to take in a little extra money. People have noticed your skill and have frequently come to you to make something for them or to repair a pesky device or item. Every time you’ve amazed them at how quickly you do your work and how few resources you squander in the process. Likewise, the Bountiful Venture Company noticed your skill at not only creating wonderful wares, but also how effortlessly and efficiently you work in yourtrade. You always seem to make do with less, often in unexpected ways.</li> 
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Choose one Craft or Profession skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with that skill. In addition, the time required for you to create a magic item is decreased. You require only 8 hours for every 1,500 gp in the item’s base price (instead of the normal 8 hours per 1,000 gp). You can create potions and scrolls whose base price is 375 gp in just 2 hours; potions and scrolls with a base price more than 375 gp but less than 1,500 gp take 8 hours to create, just like any other magic item.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Seasoned Hunter:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You grew up hunting every season, any season. Maybe you grew up in a rural area and hunted to put food on the table, or perhaps you come from a comfortable lifestyle where hunting for sport is an excellent excuse to camp in the wilderness and hone your skills. After sharing stories of your most exciting hunts and proving to them that you can hit a bull’s eye at 100 feet, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition assured that you can provide food and security to the young colony.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Pick one of the following creature types: aberration, animal, magical beast, or vermin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls or damage rolls (choose one; once chosen it can’t be changed) against creatures of that type.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Set Mind:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - Every time that you’ve said you’d do something, you’ve made sure to follow through. You can’t remember a time when you weren’t this way. People have a hard time making you change your mind once you’ve set yourself on a certain path. You might be exceptionally stubborn or you may just have a particular determination. Either way, you’re going to keep doing what you set your mind to. The Bountiful Venture Company recognized this useful trait of yours and selected you for the second wave of colonists because of your great resolve and unswerving dedication to what you set your mind upon.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect that would cause you to act differently than you normally would, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Skillful:</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek;">
            <li><i>Background</i> - You’ve always been interested in a wide array of things, and growing up you’ve spent time honing some of these talents, which has helped you in life. Some have attributed your successes to luck, but others have recognized what you truly have—skill. This interest in and practice of a diverse array of skills and abilities has served you well in a number of different jobs, and following in your varied interests you learned of the expedition to the ruins of Azlant. After your application, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition because your skillful approach to matters would be helpful for a growing colony.</li>
            <li><i>Benefit</i> - Once per day when you fail an Acrobatics, Climb, Spellcraft, Stealth, or Use Magic Device check, you can immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it’s worse.</li>

      <h2>Critical Local Customs</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Details on local customs it is critical to understand:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Glossary:</b> Adel: A small, personal barge; Dottari: Westcrown city guard; Durotas: Captain of the city guard; Duxotar: Commander of the city guard; Egorani: A person or thing from Egorian; Haloran: A magical lantern-bearing staff; Vaneo: A Chelish manor house; Vira: A Chelish estate; Wiscrani: A person or thing from Westcrown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Hellknight Ranks:</b> Lictor: General of a Hellknight order; Vicarius: Spellcasting leader of Hellknight order (alternative to Lictor, rare); Master/Mistress of Blades: Colonel of a Hellknight order; Paravicar: Lieutenant Colonel of a Hellknight Order; Paralictor: Major officer of a Hellknight order; Maralictor: Lieutenant of a Hellknight order; Signifier: A Hellknight spellcaster; Hellknight: A Hellknight rank-and-file soldier; Armiger: A Hellknight in training.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>How to Offer a Bribe:</b> Bribes are not illegal in Cheliax. In fact, the <i>Disciplines</i> specifically encourage it, and lays out the specific route and formula for offering a bribe, allowing the wealthy a legal way to seek amnesty. Crimes have a minimum payment based on seriousness and a maximum value; offering too little is insulting but offering too much is a grave crime. Between these two numbers is a meager range, and the appropriate value is based on how much the individual can pay, the severity of the crime, and the status of parties affected. Bribes are then accounted for, with a percentage kept by the arresting officer and the rest funneled up the chain of command. Be careful though, when offering a bribe, one must never use the word "bribe." Instead, they should offer to donate to the officers favorite charity, ask if a certain amount might cover the fine, and so on. A rare few number of officers and magistrates may find the offer of a bribe as insulting to their integrity, and bribes are for crime and vice - never for hurrying along government bussiness, which implies inefficiency and is on par with blasphemy. Finally, you should never offer a bribe to a Hellknight, which is an invitation for a beating. Below are several common offenses and a good general range for a bribe:
          <ul>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Public Lewdness:</i> 5cp-10gp</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Breaking the Peace:</i> 1sp-25gp</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Larceny:</i> 5sp-100gp</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Assault:</i> 10sp-50gp</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Murder:</i> 20sp-20,000gp</li>
            <li style="display: none;"><i>Blasphemy:</i> 1,000gp-10,000gp</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Racism and Slavery:</b> Chelaxians look down on those who are not of human heritage, with tieflings being a particular embarrasment, though that doesn't affect dwarves much. Non-humans, non dwarves that cannot pass-as-human will face rascism in Westcrown and start with 20% less character wealth by level. Catfolk, Gnomes, Goblins, Halflings, and Hobgobblins are also commonly enslaved, requiring players of that race to carry their freedom papers on their person, giving them a slavery background, and starting with 40% reduced character wealth by level.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>River Edicts:</b> While the details are complicated, the main theme of the Laws of Travel, also known as the river edicts, prevents the halting of vessels traveling out into open sea by anyone or the blocking or closing of any canal without the authority of the Duxotar or someone of higher rank. Additionally, moving or moored imperial craft cannot be approached within 50 or 100 ft. respectively. Finally, you may never attack a vessel from the shore unless in the defense of city property. Regarding shore rights, there are no mandetory births for non-imperial craft at any dockings.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Shadow Beasts:</b> These strange creatures first surfaced in 4676 ar. The dottari were unable to deal with the problem, as were mercenaries, so the mayor declared a curfew to keep citizens off the streets; the curfew remains in place over 30 years later. Today, with the dying of each day’s light, businesses hurriedly close and respectable homes light lanterns outside their doors. The dottari light pyrahje (man-sized torches) throughout certain major streets in the city and patrol between these islands of light. Taverns and similar establishments maintain sleeping rolls for those who stay after dark, collecting a customary 2 sp fee for boarders soon after twilight. Those forced onto the street after dark typically carry halorans, 7-foot-tall hooked staves hung with bright lanterns, made publicly available along the city’s most traveled avenues.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Temples:</b> Outsiders are often suprised at the tolerance Cheliax shows towards other religions, even those of good aligned gods, but Chelaxians are invited to offer their praise to other gods as well so long as they abide by a few strictures: First, they must not speak agaisnt Asmodeus, his heirachy, or his followers. They must not speak against the aristocracy or encourage dissent. They must abide the laws of Cheliax. They must live quietly without drawing attention to themselves. Finally, ranking priests must register themselves and keep records of all priests within the country. The only forbidden faiths and cults, upon pain of torture and execution, are any gods of chaos, demons, and Rovagug, even if worshippers are supposedly permitted their own beliefs.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Tithing:</b> Other than during unholy days, every citizen of Cheliax is expected to attend a service at a church of Asmodeus each Sunday, under penalty of public shame until the following Sunday. At those services, only lip service to the Archdevil is required, though everyone must pay it. People are also expected to pay their tithe - a single silver coin worth 2 gold helms - at the first service of the month, nicknamed the "Devil's Due". The priests may pardon individuals for not paying because they lack the means, while the others are arrested for tax evasion. In theory, this comes down to the priests knowing their congregation best, but it is an arbetrary thing.</li>
