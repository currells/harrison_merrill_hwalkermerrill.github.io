    <i>“My travels have taken me to amazing and dangerous places all over the world and beyond, but nothing prepared me for the sights that I’d see beneath the surface of Golarion’s oceans. I’ve been to the frozen ends of the world, the darkest depths of the Darklands, the ugly sore known as the Worldwound, and even other planes of existence, but nothing has been so alien or dangerous. I first visited a settlement of aquatic elves off the coast of Cheliax and then set out for deeper waters. I’ve seen magically worked coral that provided safe settlement for hundreds of beings. I snuck around the cave openings bored into the side of a massive underwater trench, making sure not to arouse the notice of the devilfish that lived within. I even learned a secret way down the Braid, the massive inverted waterspout that leads to the Sightless Sea, though I don’t plan on venturing there anytime soon.”</i>

      <h3>Gervus Barhandin - <i>Skeleton Lights</i></h3>
      <img src="images/local-gervus-barhandin.png" alt="Gervus Barhandin">
      <p>This tightly-knit community of Gillman had been stuck in a cycle of cullings every couple of generations, a secret held by the elders in the community. Their atempts to avert the most recent cycle led to some of them hiding in caves and turning to canabalism while others attempted to stop the cycle from happening before becoming corrupted by it. After slaying a weakened and recently awoken aboleth that was attempting to escape its imprisonment, the community is suddenly free, and knows it is related to the many skum that inhabits Azlanti waters.</p>
      <!-- <p>Special: Bonetown has been evacuated, leaving the whalebone village a ransacked-skeleton of its former self.</p> -->
      <p>Boons: Unlocks the Azlanti Heritage Feat for Gillman.</p>

      <h2>Ghosthater Goblin Tribe</h2>
      <h3>Gimble the Hoarder - <i>Waka Waka Eh Eh</i></h3>
      <img src="images/local-ghosthater-goblin.png" alt="Ghosthater Goblins">
      <p>The Ghosthater Goblin Tribe is the dominant goblin tribe on the island of Ancorato, so named because their tribal coming-of-age ritual requires the monkey goblin adolescents to charge through and kill the ghost at the pink circle without showing fear. While the tribe considered moving into the abandoned Talmandor's Bounty colony, they have instead established a peaceful trade relationship, and are located only an hours hike away.</p>
      <p>Special: The Ghosthater Tribe is small but mighty. Each time the leader of one of their rival gangs are defeated, they grow in size, strength, and wealth. Their rivals are the Shellcrakers (defeated), Blood Shells, Dead Keepers, Moon Screamers, and Spider Biters.</p>
      <p>Boons: Unlock Monkey Goblin as playable race; Unlock Gimble the Hoarder as a merchant; Upgraded Size: 2</p>
      <p>POC: Stops in at the <i>Halway Here Tradin' Post</i> each week to make exchanges with the colony (via Kalcora Weems) and update Kalcora on their stock.</p>

      <h2>Helekhterie</h2>
      <h3>The Sea Hag and her Croanies</h3>
      <img src="images/local-helekhterie.png" alt="Helekhterie">
      <p>A powerful sea hag, Helekhterie, has conscripted several denizens of the sea to kidnap humanoids for her experiments in the ancient labratory at Nal-Shakar. Powerful and deranged, she has many followers on land and sea.</p>
      <p>Koloshkora and their hunting party have been being hunted by sahuagin following the sea hag Helekhterie, who have taken over Esharni Reef to use as their base of operations, pushing out the sea dragon that once dwelled there.</p>
      <p>Gervus Barhandin evacuated their town after people were being taken by skum, taking shelter in the caves. Though the cycle seems to have involved an aboleth on the mysterious island of Nal-Kashel, some whisper that they originally served the sea hag Helekhterie, and they thought hidding was their only option.</p>
      <p>Skurnagh the Scrag has warned the party about Helekhterie, given them directions to her lair at Nal-Shakar - located at the center of the island in a caldera - revealed the location of the flooded secret entrance, and given them his Necklace of Air Adaptation, which will allow them to safely bipass the danger the hag placed to guard the secret entrance. While his kin, Folkir and Skekkora, still follow the hag, Skurnagh does not plead for their lives.</p>
      <p>Vriskirsa was chased out of Esharni Reef by the Elder Maw and its Sahuagin Caretakers whom were serving the sea had Helekhterie. They were enslaving any huymanoids they could find and trading them with the sea hag, who needed more bodies for her experiments.</p>

      <h2>Okoloro Tribe of Locathah</h2>
      <h3>Koloshkora - <i>Nomadic Marketplace</i></h3>
      <img src="images/local-koloshkora.png" alt="Koloshkora, Okoloro Tribe">
      <p>The Okoloro, a locathah tribe native to the waters surrounding Ancorato, occasionally settle on the western shores of the island to hunt in the shallows and satisfy their curiosity for the surface world with brief expeditions inland to forage for tubers, which they consider a delicacy. This temporary settlement is a migratory hunting camp, and the locathahs here live most of the time in a small community not far from Ancorato, with frequent forays to Talasantri, the largest undersea settlement in the region. The locathahs are generally a friendly and affable people, quick to make alliances and forge social bonds with land-dwelling creatures. The locathahs appear slow and ungainly on land, but those seen swimming in the shallows around the coast move with a startling speed and grace.</p>
      <!-- <p>Special: While friendly to surfacers, they are currently unable to trade, due to being frequently preyed upon by a group of sahuagin hunters at a shole near the island.</p> -->
      <p>Boons: Unlock Locathah as a playable race; Unlock Koloshkora as a merchant</p>
      <p>Trade Stock: (BV: 2k; Limit: 5k) Due to their many trade agreements, they have access to some items at higher values than normal, giving them a decent chance at having items worth up to 5kgp and a tiny chance of having items worth up to 15kgp. Trade Stock takes 8 hours for them to retrieve, while items costing more than 2kgp take 24 hours, and items costing more than 5kgp taking 2d4 days. Items they trade are typically water-fast, such as scrolls being made of whaleskin instead of paper. They only pay 25% for items that enhance underwater movement or magic items that do not function underwater or when wet, but will occasionally pay 100% value for interesting items unique to the surface, particularly if they enable surface exploration.</p>
      <p>Special Stock: <i>(d) Scroll of Darkness (CL1); Deathwatch Eyes; (d) Scroll of Spike Growth (CL5); Bracers of Archery (lesser); Darkwood Towershield; (d) Scroll of Shield of Faith (CL1); Cloak of Elvenkind; Mithral Heavy Shield; Verdant Vine; Feather Step SLippers; Potion of Mage Armor (CL1); Vampiric Gloves; Silent Metamagic Rod (lesser); Spidersilk Cacoon Cloak*</i></p>
