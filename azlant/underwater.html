        <i>
          “The mysteries of the oceans are as deep and dark as the waters themselves. These are the primeval birthing pits of the world, where creatures as ancient as the world’s heart still swim in hidden trenches. Vast oceans sprawl beneath the ground, with never a ray of sunlight breaking their murky waters. Civilizations formed and grew, suffered and died, and the bones of their cities still lie on the ocean floors.
          <br><br>"The oceans guard their secrets well. Those finned and gilled beings who call the waters home think they understand it, but the ocean hides its truths even from them. Serpents that can swallow ships whole, tentacled monstrosities with ancient memories, and behemoths that rise only at the bidding of the gods inhabit the deeps.
          <br><br>"The most fervent refuse to be deterred by the oceans’ dangers. Seekers in pursuit of truly ancient knowledge and the very deepest secrets begin and end their search in the water, for that is where our world itself began and shall someday end.”
        </i>

      <h3>How does holding my breath work?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>How long can I hold it normally?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">1 round per 2x CON score.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>What reduces how long I can hold it?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Standard Actions - Every standard action reduces your remaining breath by 1 round.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Verbal Components - Every spell/ability with a verbal component reduces your remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Breath Weapons - Using a breath weapon uses up 5 rounds (must have at least 5 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Talking - A Short speech (5 sylables or less) reduces your remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Screaming - Screaming reduces remaining breath by half or by 10 rounds, whichever is greater (must have at least 5 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Being Strangled - Spells or abilities that force you to hold your breath while already holding your breath (like a chokehold) doubles your air expenditure each round.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Stolen Air - Spells or abilities that steal your breath either list the amount or temporarily suspend all remaining rounds of air (like steal breath).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Knocked Unconcious - Being knocked unconcious removes all remaining rounds of air.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>What happens when I run out of air?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">If you cannot breath at the start of your turn, you must make a Con check (not Fort) with a DC of 10 + 1 for each previous check attempted.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You cannot speak or use spells or abilities with verbal components.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You cannot attempt full-round actions (but you may still use both a move and a standard action, unless otherwise prevented).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If you fail your Con check before getting more air, you begin drowning.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b> I started drowning. What does that mean?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 1: Once you fail your Con check, you begin drowning and fall unconcious. If you were already unconcious, immediate skip to Step 2.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 2: On the start of your next turn (unless already unconcious), you begin dying and are brought to -1 hp regardless of how much health you had. If you were already at -1 or less, you take 1 point of damage (this damage counts as failing to stabilize).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 3: On the start of your next turn, you drown and die.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>I was revived underwater, how many rounds of air do I have left?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">If you fell unconcious while underwater while needing to hold your breath, you have 0 rounds remaining and you must immediately begin making Con checks to prevent drowning.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If you were unconcious and had already failed your Con check and started drowning and you still cannot breathe, you remain unconcious and go immediately to Step 2 of drowning at the start of your turn.</li>

      <h3>Tell me about Buoyancy and Currents...</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How does Buoyancy work?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Buoyancy determines how much you float or sink in the water when you fail (or don't attempt a needed) a swim check, whether you can walk underwater on the sea floor, and how easy or hard it is to swim up or down.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">What action is it to resist my bouyancy? Attempting to resist your Bouyancy is a free action at the start of your turn (or done as part of a move action), with the same Swim DC as attempting to move.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Neutral Buoyancy - If you have neutral buoyancy, you do not float or sink relative to wheree you are in the water, and you don't need to attempt a swim check to resist your buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Rising/ Sinking - If you have rising or sinking buoyancy and fail a swim check (or don't resist), at the start of your turn, you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. You move 10 feet on the first round, 20 feet on the second round, and 30 feet every round after.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Swift Buoyancy - If you have swiftly rising or sinking buoyancy, you must attempt a DC20 swim check at the start of your turn, or you are moved in the direction of your buoyancy 30 feet. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity. If swiftly rising and already at the surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stay at the surface without making any swim checks. If swiftly sinking and on a stable surface, you are not off-balance and may choose to stand on the bottom or move normally as though in difficult terrain.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Changing Buoyancy - If your buoyancy changes while being moved by your buoyancy, your buoyancy speed changes at a rate of 10 feet per round. If your buoyancy changes to swiftly rising/sinking, your buoyancy speed changes immediately.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Moving vs Buoyancy - If moving against your buoyancy (and its not nuetral), you are treated as though you are moving through difficult terrain and your speed is halved (like going upstairs). If moving with your buoyancy, you may choose to move your buoyancy speed at the start of your turn (provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding your buoyancy to your total movement.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What is my Natural Buoyancy?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - If you have the water subtype, your buoyancy is always neutral (even if affected by magic or items).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you have the aquatic subtype, you may change your buoyancy to neutral as a free action at the start of your turn (unless your buoyancy is swiftly rising/ sinking). If your buoyancy is already neutral, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Air Subtype - If you have the air subtype, your buoyancy is swiftly rising if your in a light load, rising if your in a medium load, and sinking if your in a heavy load.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Air Breathers - If you are a creature that needs to breath (like humanoids), your buoyancy is sinking if in a light, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load or wearing heavy armor.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Non Breathers - If you are a creature that does not need to breath (like constructs), your buoyancy is sinking if in a light load, and swiftly sinking if in a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>What can change my Buoyancy?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Water Subtype - nothing. The only way for a creture with the water subtype to not have neutral buoyancy is for it to change its subtype (such as via a polymorph effect)</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Aquatic Subtype - If you are not swiftly rising/ sinking, you can adjust your buoyancy to neutral at the start of your turn as a free action. If your bouyancy is neutral at the start of your turn, you may change it to rising or sinking as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Magic - Certain spells and abilities (like <i>aquakinesis</i> or <i>extreme buoyancy</i>) can change a creatures buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Equipment - Certain items can be sued to adjust your buoyancy, such as air tanks and lead anchors. The magnitude of their efefct depends on your Natural Buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Load - Picking up or dropping items to change your load can adjust your buoyancy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>How is this different from currents?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Why does it matter? Like Buoyancy, a current can move you in the water. However, a current is an outside force and may move you in any direction.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Resist Currents - Just like Bouyancy, you can resist the current as the same free action as resisting your buoyancy at the start of your turn, or as part of a move (typical DC 10-20).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Swept Away - If you fail (or choose not) to resist the current, you are moved by the current in the currents direction according to its speed. Unlike Buoyancy, this does not speed up or slow down. This movement knocks you off-balance and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures not being swept away.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Moving vs Currents - Moving against the current counts as difficult terrain and your speed is halved (like going upstairs). If moving with the current, you may choose to be swept away at the start of your turn (provoking normally) before attempting your swim check to move, effectively adding the currents speed to your total movement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How far can I move underwater?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have a swim speed!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move up to your swim speed as a move action without making a swim check (except for extreme circumstances)</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may choose to move one quarter a different speed if you like, but you gain none of the benefits of your swim speed on that movement (including your +8 bonus on swim checks).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have <i>freedom of movement / free swim</i>!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You automatically succeed on all swim checks and may choose to ignore buoyancy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You still move one quarter your speed as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move your full fly speed as a move action (<i>freedom of movement</i> only, not <i>free swim</i>).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I can ignore difficult terrain!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move one quarter your chosen speed with a successful swim check (DC 10-20) as a move action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move against your buoyancy or against the current without further reducing your speed.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may walk along the bottom at full speed as a move action if you have a swiftly sinking buoyancy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have fly, climb, burrow, fast movement, normal movement, etc.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may move one quarter your chosen speed with a successful swim check (DC 10-20) as a move action.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I have non-neutral buoyancy, but I'm not being dragged.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You must attempt a swim check each round as a free action at the start of your turn to maintain your depth, or as part of your move action to move.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If you fail your swim check, you move in the direction of your buoyancy. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may attempt to move normally with one of your movement speeds, but moving against your buoyancy counts as difficult terrain.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may allow yourself to be dragged by your buoyancy as a free action at the start of your turn. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>I am or I want to be dragged by my buoyancy or the current.</b>
        <li style="display: none;">You may allow yourself to be dragged by your buoyancy or the current as a free action at the start of your turn. This knocks you off-balance and the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You may attempt to not be dragged by your buoyancy or the current as a move action at the start of your turn (Dc 10-20). A success means you stop moving through the water and are no longer off-balance. You may only attempt this action once each turn.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If swiftly rising and at the surface, you are no longer off balance and may act normally.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If swiftly sinking and on a stable surface, you are no longer off balance, may act normally, and may walk at half speed (as though on difficult terrain), burrow normally, or climb against the ground at full (climb) speed.</li>

      <h3>How does water affect different types of spells and abilities?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Acid</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuraction (creation) - These spells conjure acid to deal damage and are diluted by open water to the point where they become harmless (example, <i>acid splash</i>).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Evocation - These spells deal raw acid damage and are unaffected by water (example, <i>fireball</i> affected by Elemental Spell metamagic).</li>
      </ul>
      </ul><ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Clouds and Weather</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Bubble Spells - Bubble effects (such as <i>air bubble</i> and <i>invisibility bubble</i>) always work underwater and are often designed to work in enviornments where other spells of their type would not function.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuration Clouds - Spells that conjure a cloud of something (like <i>fog cloud</i> or <i>glitterdust</i>) or mimic the effect of a conjuration cloud (like <i>virulent miasma</i>) do not function underwater unless they explicitly state otherwise.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Transmutation Clouds - Spells that turn something into a cloud (like <i>gaseous form</i>) and spells that mimic those effects do not function underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Illusion, Enchantment, and Evocation Clouds - Illusiory or Enchanting clouds and abilities function normally in the water, as they are not creating a real substance. Evocation clouds (like aggressive thundercloud) function normally, but cannot manifest its presence and dissipate after 1 round as if dispelled.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Wind effects - Wind effects cannot manifest underwater at all.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Weather Spells - Many weather spells adjust weather conditions on land (such as <i>sleet storm</i>) and cannot work underwater at all. Others only adjust conditions on the surface (such as <i>control weather</i>) and have limited effect at depths below the surface and near zero effect below 100 feet. Illusiory effects, however, always function.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Cold</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Conjuration - Spells that conjure ice work normally underwater.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Cold Damage - Spells that deal cold damage (such as <i>cone of cold) that do not conjure cold directly instead deal half cold, half piercing damage as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Magical Electricity</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Ranged Touch Electricity - Spells that create electricity and deal damage at range hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, except it lacks the normal visual and audible components of combusted air. Treat these spells as though they are invisible (+2 attack, target is flat-footed) the first time this type of spell is cast by that caster in combat. This effect cannot be overcome by abilities that detect only magical invisibility (such as <i>true seeing</i>) or rely on sound or scent to overcome invisibility (such as sonar) but can be otherwise overcome by blindsight.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Touch, Area of Effect, and Partial-Electricity spells - The electricity portion of these spells function normally.</li>
