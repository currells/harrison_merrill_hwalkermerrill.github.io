        <i>
          “The mysteries of the oceans are as deep and dark as the waters themselves. These are the primeval birthing pits of the world, where creatures as ancient as the world’s heart still swim in hidden trenches. Vast oceans sprawl beneath the ground, with never a ray of sunlight breaking their murky waters. Civilizations formed and grew, suffered and died, and the bones of their cities still lie on the ocean floors.
          <br><br>"The oceans guard their secrets well. Those finned and gilled beings who call the waters home think they understand it, but the ocean hides its truths even from them. Serpents that can swallow ships whole, tentacled monstrosities with ancient memories, and behemoths that rise only at the bidding of the gods inhabit the deeps.
          <br><br>"The most fervent refuse to be deterred by the oceans’ dangers. Seekers in pursuit of truly ancient knowledge and the very deepest secrets begin and end their search in the water, for that is where our world itself began and shall someday end.”
        </i>

      <h3>When do I need to make a Swim check while in the water?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>I have <i>freedom of movement</i>!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Nope, I don't make swim checks.</li>
      </ul>  
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>I have a swim speed!</b>
        <li style="display: none;">I'm stuck! (pinned by a rock, leg wrapped in seaweed, etc.) Swim DC set by obstacle (default 15-30).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I'm being swept away! (Rapids, powerful current, etc.) Swim DC20 to resist, and I may take a 10.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I'm fighting rapid bouyancy! (Magic, Heavy Armor, Underwater Gyser, etc.) Swim DC20 to resist, and I may take a 10.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I've been knocked off balance! Swim DC equal to previously failed Swim check OR equal to Combat Maneuver that knocked you off balance (Trip, Bull Rush, etc.), and I may take a 10.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I've been swimming for an hour! Swim DC20 or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and fatigue.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>I don't have any of the above...</b>
        <li style="display: none;">I want to move. Swim DC 10-20 depending on conditions.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I don't want to move, but I want to resist my bouyancy. Same Swim DC as set by conditions, or DC20 if rapidly rising/ sinking.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I'm stuck or being swept away! (pinned by a rock, powerful current) Swim DC20</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I've been knocked off balance! Swim DC equal to previously failed Swim check OR equal to Combat Maneuver that knocked you off balance (Trip, Bull Rush, etc.).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">I've been swimming for an hour! Swim DC20 or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and fatigue.</li>

      <h3>How does holding my breath work?</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>How long can I hold it normally?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">1 round per 2x CON score.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>What reduces how long I can hold it?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Every standard action reduces your remaining breath by 1 round.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Every spell/ability with a verbal component reduces your remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Using a breath weapon uses up 5 rounds (must have at least 5 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Short speach (5 sylables or less) reduces your remaining breath by 3 rounds (must have at least 3 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Screaming reduces remaining breath by half or by 10 rounds, whichever is greater (must have at least 5 rounds left).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Spells or abilities that force you to hold your breath while already holding your breath (like a chokehold) doubles your air expenditure each round.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Spells or abilities that steal your breath either list the amount or temporarily suspend all remaining rounds of air (like steal breath).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Being knocked unconcious removes all remaining rounds of air.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b>What happens when I run out of air?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">If you cannot breath at the start of your turn, you must make a Con check (not Fort) with a DC of 10 + 1 for each previous check attempted.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You cannot speak or use spells or abilities with verbal components.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">You cannot attempt full-round actions (but you may still use both a move and a standard action, unless otherwise prevented).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">If you fail your Con check before getting more air, you begin drowning.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"> <b> I started drowning. What does that mean?</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 1: Once you fail your Con check, you begin drowning and fall unconcious. If you were already unconcious, skip to the next step</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 2: On the start of your next turn (unless already unconcious), you begin dying and are brought to -1 hp regardless of how much health you had. If you were already at -1 or less, you take 1 point of damage (which may kill you normally, though that is unlikely).</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Step 3: On the start of your next turn, you drown and die.</li>
      </ul>
