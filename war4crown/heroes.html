        <p>Slim and athletic, Princess Eutropia bears the distinctive cheekbones and nose of her Stavian father and grandmother. Despite the ostentatious jewelry she wears, her gown and hair are more conservative than that of most other nobles'. The Princess Eutropia is trying to become heir apparent for the Primogen Crown and campaigns for increased rights along with the shaking off of the shackles of some of Taldors traditions. While well educated, she is relatively naive and must grow a great deal to be worthy of the Primogen Crown.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">While preparing to lead, the Princess Eutropia learned some lessons from her agents' decisions:
          <li>Neglecting Malphene Trant, leading to her evetual suicide, taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - there simply isn't enough time to save everyone.</li>
          <li>Saving most of the nobles traped beneath the senate building taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - save whom you can, if you can.</li>
          <li>Sending a raiding party of Pathfinders before attacking the Silent Repository taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - resources are best used when coordinated.</li>
          <li>Killing Count Bartelby Lotheed taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - not everyone deserves mercy, and some deserve death.</li>
          <li>Allying with Baron Okerra over the Night Swan taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - good allies should be embraced.</li>
          <li>Exonerating Anllel Oakleaf during the Stachys Trials taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - just because its popular doesn't mean its right.</li>
          <li>Slaughtering some of the charmed townsfolk of Yanmass taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - things are easiest when obstacles are removed quickly.</li>
          <li>Befriending Gallindra Jonrek in the Yanmass City Park taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - those who fight against us may become valuable allies.</li>
          <li>Defeating the Kozan Bravos taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - while most opposition can be ignored, tenacious opposition is best subdued.</li>
          <li>Working to restore the petrified soldiers to life taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - nobody gets left behind or forgotten.</li>
          <li>Rescuing Cassandra Florint, who turned out to be a Lion Blade, from the Encircling Bower's dungeon taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - saving others can lead to them saving you.</li>
          <li>Attempting to bargin with the psychopomp Xan taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - anyone can make a good ally.</li>
          <li>Utilizing some of Milon Jeroth's spy network to assasinate Baron Astor Rhoderus taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - a tool may be wielded by any craftsman.</li>
          <li>Solving the murder of Tae Amalon taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>compassion</b> - everyone matters, including the dead.</li>
          <li>Discovering Prince Stavian III was shocking, so he was taken by the Lion's Blades to a secluded retirement. This taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>practicality</b> - Even if you love them, sometimes it's best to send people away.</li>
          <li>Killing Maxillar Pythareus taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in <b>efficiency</b> - if people wont surrender, kill them where they stand.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p><b>Summary of Lessons Learned</b> - Efficiency: 4; Practicality: 6; Compassion: 6</p>

        <h3>Princess Eutropia's Legacy - Userper of the Throne</h3>
        <!-- <p>Once the Princess, while Eutropia still vies for the throne, her prospects look bleek as her funds have run nearly dry, she has no apparent agents or machinations of mention on the public stage, and most of the powerful grand dukes and grand duchesses are either competing for the crown themselves or else backing High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus. While the Princess stil has some support, most of those sympathetic to her bid for the Primogen Crown have relatively little political or military weight.</p> -->
        <!--<p>The Princess of Taldor, Eutropia has reclaimed the Palace of Birdsong, and with a stable base of opperations and income, has been able to both recruit agents and rebuild her court. Proving both practical and compassionate on the political stage, her support base has unified as the "Loyalist" party and is competing with only a few remaining claimants, with High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus at the head of the opposition "Imperialist" party.</p>-->
        <p>With her entire family's claim to the Throne proven illigitemate, and her family's rumored legacy of madness now popularly attributed to the Adella Family Curse, she is looked at by many as a bloodless usurper at best, and a bloody instigator of civil war at worst. The War for the Crown started because of her pursuits for reform, after all, and now with the country tearing itself apart, Princess Eutropia is the only living person with power worth blaming.</p>
        <!--<p>While some saw her as an instigator and others saw her as a martyr, she is dead all the same.</p>-->

          <p>"Well met, loyal friends. With the Palace of Birdsong now bustling with activity between artisans commisioned to restore its faded glory and visiting diplomats crowding the halls, things have been rather busy lately. I hope you've all enjoyed a well-deserved rest; I'd offer more, but I've been giving the serving staff a lot of days off in light of recent... traumas, and we've been a bit short-handed.</p>
          <p>“Let me ask: How much do you know about Yanmass? If it isn’t much, I have a few books you can read on your way, because that’s your next stop. The city has been neutral up until now but commands considerable wealth and access to exclusive trade goods; its support would be invaluable, and the princess and Pythareus have both sent delegations to win an alliance with the Mercantile Council that runs the city. But our agent, Sir Meir Dratavis, has gone missing. His last correspondence mentioned troubling recent events: bandit raids, cult activity, missing soldiers. He was working alongside Pythareus’s representative, an earl named Yander Merkondus, to resolve the problems, but I haven’t heard anything since, and I suspect foul play. Find Meir, or else continue his work of convincing Yanmass to formally back Eutropia.</p>
          <p>"Given how much we need to win over the Mercantile Council's support, please do your best to not only curry their favor, but also to try and deal with the problems they and the people they represent have been facing. These people live in a precarious region, and while we want to earn their support, we also want to better their lives as much as we can, and avoid war at all costs, both foreign and civil.</p>
          <p>"This leaves much on your plates, which is why I must dispatch you so quickly. Your assingments are to find Sir Meir Dratavis and save him if you can, curry favor with the council, help the people secure their town and caravans from their raider problem, try to find the missing soldiers and discover why they've either dissapeared or deserted, try to uncover the beliefs and intentions of this new Cult of the Twilight Child, and prevent war with both the Padisha Empire of Kelesh and especially between Taldor Claimants.</p>
          <p>"Good luck, agents. Keep me appraised and I'll support you all as best I can, though in truth, I'm counting on you. History is riding on your ability to perceive, discern, and intervene. May Taldor endure!"</p>
          <p>Martella Lotheed</p>

        <!--<i>
          <p>“You’ve shown great promise, and I see why Eutropia relies on you. I’m sorry that the question of succession has soured the relationship between the princess and the Lion Blades, but ultimately our loyalty must always be to the nation and the Taldan people. To take sides in a political conflict is to dilute our power and purpose. But now it seems that political conflict is spilling over into national security. Lady Lotheed brought us the documents you recovered in Zimar, and they corroborate similar reports we’ve gathered from Sardis Township, Pol, and Demgazi. Maxillar Pythareus is rattling his saber for war, and he appears to be spilling Taldan blood to get it.</p>
          <p>“For a time we shared the same uneasy peace with Maxillar Pythareus’s Imperialist faction that we share with Eutropia’s Loyalists. But all at once, as we began to receive reports of these ‘Qadiran’ attacks, our agents in Zimar were set upon and eliminated in a single, coordinated attack. I barely made it out of the city alive, and I appear to be the only one. Now I’m too well known in the area to keep a low profile. You’ll be the ones to continue the investigation in Zimar on behalf of the Lion Blades.</p>
          <p>“This is not an easy task laid out before you. Many believe Pythareus is the Grand Prince of Taldor, and he is defended accordingly, not to mention that you will be attempting to prove him guilty of high crimes. Furthermore, he is obviously operating his own intelligence network, one run by Milon Jeroth, a former associate of the Lion Blades and one of the most ruthless and underhanded operatives I have ever encountered. We believe one of our agents, Gannaius, may have escaped the purge, and locating him will be your top priority for now. We can provide you with false identities, and I can accompany you as far south as Panemona to act as an advisor, but you will be alone in the lion’s den. I cannot enter the city to protect you without alerting Pythareus’s diviner and bringing far more pain down upon you.</p>
          <p>"Despite the distances, I will be your handler for this operation, as I am both familiar with Lady Martella and Princess Eutropia, and I am the most senior operative to have been in Zimar in the past month. Any questions you have or evidence you find should be coordinated through me, and it will be my job to convince the other Lion Blades to arrest Pythareus. Here is one last thing you must understand clearly: this investigation was greenlit because of evidence so-far discovered about the High Strategos, but the Lion Blades have long been politacally neutral and loyal to the country and - to a lesser extent - to the throne. The Lion Blades are wary of eliminating one of the most powerful politicians and military leaders in Taldor, both because it leaves the nation uniquely vulnerable and becasue such an attack would likely turn the small skirmishes of the current political situation into rioting and possibly a full and open civil war. Because of that, the Lion Blades need information, not blood, and will require at least three strong pieces of evidence revealing the High Strategos's treasonous behavior, such as hand-written and signed letters or one of his cabinet testifying willingly against him, before authorizing his arrest. Until such evidence can be found and an arrest or assasination order is given, you are only authorized to investigate Maxillar Pythareus for evidence of crimes committed, and any direct action against the High Strategos will make you enemies of the Lion Blades. Are you clear on what your nation needs from you?"</p>

          <p>"It is my pleasure to congradulate you on your many extraodinary deeds from the last several months, but I'm afraid my visit isn't mearely a polite social call.</p>
          <p>"The last few days have certainly been... exciting."</p>
          <!--<p>“Your work deposing Maxillar Pythareus was decisive, yet he was no fool. Within the past decade he had uncovered evidence that the entire Stavian line was born illegitimately, beginning with Stavian I two-hundred years ago. Worse, their line seems descended from the long-lost Adella family, utterly reviled for their indulgence, treachery, and violence. Pythareus’s closest agents held this damning information in reserve, and now that their leader is undone, they have verified and published the documents. This discredits the entire family and delegitimizes Eutropia’s claim based on her parentage. Now more contenders than ever are circling like vultures. We need a decisive sign.</p>
          <p>“Taldor takes its name from its founding emperor, Taldaris. His name’s still uttered from the fields to the palaces, and although historical records of his policies are vague, that doesn’t stop senators from claiming to act on his vision. In Taldor’s past, the grand prince could call upon Taldaris’s spirit for guidance, and it was said that Taldaris’s legendary Mantle of Kings would glow when donned by the empire’s rightful ruler. The First Emperor‘s blessing was practically sacred, and it would be equally decisive today.</p>
          <p>“The dubious Grand Prince Uirtamon II worried his rivals would use the mantle against him, so he had it reinterred in Taldaris’s tomb, which he then ordered buried and its location scrubbed from public records. Thankfully, my Pathfinder Society agents are excellent archivists. Together we have pieced together the approximate location of the Tomb of the First Emperor, as well as the rudiments of the ritual to call upon Taldaris’s spirit to empower the Mantle of Kings. What we need now are capable operatives able to survey the area, locate the tomb, find the Mantle of Kings within, and contact the spirit of Taldaris to ask that he bless the garment.</p>
          <p>“We need this—not just for Eutropia but for Taldor. If the mantle reappears and glows on her shoulders, it stands to prevent considerable bloodshed. Even if it does not select her, it will allow us a nonviolent means to identifying a worthy heir without the need for drawn blades.”</p>
