        <p>Slim and athletic, Princess Eutropia bears the distinctive cheekbones and nose of her Stavian father and grandmother. Despite the ostentatious jewelry she wears, her gown and hair are more conservative than that of most other nobles'. The Princess Eutropia is trying to become heir apparent for the Primogen Crown and campaigns for increased rights along with the shaking off of the shackles of some of Taldors traditions. While well educated, she is relatively naive and must grow a great deal to be worthy of the Primogen Crown.</p>
        <p>The PC's neglect of Malphene Trant, leading to her evetual suicide, taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in practicality - not everyone can be saved.</p>
        <p>The PC's decision to buy and sell to Mimips, the Kobold merchant, taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in practicality - sometimes a good choice is less-than ideal.</p>
        <p>The PC's saving most of the nobles who were traped beneath the senate building taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in compassion - if you can, save whom you can.</p>
        <p>The PC's decision to send in a raiding party of Pathfinders before attacking the Silent Repository taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in practicality - there are several solutions to every problem.</p>
        <p>The Stachys trials resulted in Lucinia Mag being sentenced to community service taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in compassion - sometimes the best solution is outreach, even if its not the cheapest.</p>
        <p>The Stachys trials exonerated Anllel Oakleaf and taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in compassion - just because its what people want doesn't mean its what's right.</p>
        <p>The Stachys trials exonerated Partulles Mayne and taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in compassion - just because its what people want doesn't mean its what's right.</p>
        <p>The PC's descision to ally with Baron Okerra over the Night Swan taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in practicality - good allies should be embraced.</p>
        <p>The PC's investment of 16,000gp into Stachy's taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in practicality - it's important to improve lives and infrastructure, but only when the cost is reasonably considered.</p>
        <p>The PC's decision to kill Count Bartelby Lotheed taught Princess Eutropia a lesson in efficiency - not everyone deserves mercy, and some deserve death.</p>
        <p><b>Lessons Learned</b> - Efficiency: 1 ; Practicality: 5 ; Compassion: 4</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Princess Eutropia's Legacy - One-time Princess</h3>
        <!-- <p>Once the Princess, while Eutropia still vies for the throne, her prospects look bleek as her funds have run nearly dry, she has no apparent agents or machinations of mention on the public stage, and most of the powerful grand dukes and grand duchesses are either competing for the crown themselves or else backing High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus. While the Princess stil has some support, most of those sympathetic to her bid for the Primogen Crown have relatively little political or military weight.</p> -->
        <p>The Princess of Taldor, Eutropia has reclaimed the Palace of Birdsong, and with a stable base of opperations and income, has been able to both recruit agents and rebuild her court. Proving both practical and compassionate on the political stage, her support base has unified as the "Loyalist" party and is competing with only a few remaining claimants, with High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus at the head of the opposition "Imperialist" party.</p>

      <i>
        <p>"Well met, loyal friends. With the Palace of Birdsong now bustling with activity between artisans commisioned to restore its faded glory and visiting diplomats crowding the halls, things have been rather busy lately. I hope you've all enjoyed a well-deserved rest; I'd offer more, but I've been giving the serving staff a lot of days off in light of recent... traumas, and we've been a bit short-handed.</p>
        <p>“Let me ask: How much do you know about Yanmass? If it isn’t much, I have a few books you can read on your way, because that’s your next stop. The city has been neutral up until now but commands considerable wealth and access to exclusive trade goods; its support would be invaluable, and the princess and Pythareus have both sent delegations to win an alliance with the Mercantile Council that runs the city. But our agent, Sir Meir Dratavis, has gone missing. His last correspondence mentioned troubling recent events: bandit raids, cult activity, missing soldiers. He was working alongside Pythareus’s representative, an earl named Yander Merkondus, to resolve the problems, but I haven’t heard anything since, and I suspect foul play. Find Meir, or else continue his work of convincing Yanmass to formally back Eutropia.</p>
        <p>"Given how much we need to win over the Mercantile Council's support, please do your best to not only curry their favor, but also to try and deal with the problems they and the people they represent have been facing. These people live in a precarious region, and while we want to earn their support, we also want to better their lives as much as we can, and avoid war at all costs, both foreign and civil.</p>
        <p>"This leaves much on your plates, which is why I must dispatch you so quickly. Your assingments are to find Sir Meir Dratavis and save him if you can, curry favor with the council, help the people secure their town and caravans from their raider problem, try to find the missing soldiers and discover why they've either dissapeared or deserted, try to uncover the beliefs and intentions of this new Cult of the Twilight Child, and prevent war with both the Padisha Empire of Kelesh and especially between Taldor Claimants.</p>
        <p>"Good luck, agents. Keep me appraised and I'll support you all as best I can, though in truth, I'm counting on you. History is riding on your ability to perceive, discern, and intervene. May Taldor endure!"</p>
