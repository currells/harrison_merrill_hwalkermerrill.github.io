          <li>Talbot: This starkly conservative family are merchants and entrepreneurs first and aristocrats second, willing to forgo duty if they can instead pursue profit</li>
          <li>Varima: This family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra centuries ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara’s social scene</li>
          <li>Vernisant: This family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it!</li>
          <li>Vinmark: Newcomers and outsiders, this Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted their family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard</li>
          <li>Zespire: This family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility, Allies: House Heskillar, Enemies: House Merrosett, Family Story Feat: Lighting the Way</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Ennoi: This family of "Andoren Sympathizers" has long fallen from their former lofty places</li>

          <li>Solari: Recently taking control of a grand duchy, the Solari family is highly manipulative and cunning</li>
          <li>Tiberan: A family of traders and pirate-hunters, House Tiberan controls the port-city of Cassomir and has the greatest trade reach, though they lack the familial numbers to wield major influence</li>
          <li>Vort: Controlling the critical heartland county of Lionsmane, located next to Meratt and between both Cassomir and Oppara, the vort family is responsible for securing much of the canals and highways between the two giant Cities</li>
          <li>Zellvyngian: This incredibly corrupt house of lesser nobles has risen to some minor prominence over the last dacade due to kickbacks from criminal land deals</li>
