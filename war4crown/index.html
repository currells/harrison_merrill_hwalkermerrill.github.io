        <h2>Campaign Details</h2>
        <p>This is a reference point for many of the details for this specific campaign</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
          <li>Alignment: No Restrictions, Nuetral Good recommended</li>
          <li>Class: No restrictions, high-skill and charisma characters recommended, bloodline (except Imperious), druid, occult, oracle, shaman, summoner, and witch classes discouraged (superstitious townsfolk)</li>
          <li>Languages: Official: Common (aka Taldane), Recommended: Azlanti, Celestial, Elven, Kelish, Kellid, Hallit, Skald, Osiriani</li>
          <li>Origins: Any Inner Sea Region, Avistan, or Garund, Recommended: given the nature of this campaign, characters would do best choosing to be Taldan natives from middle- or upper-class families, though that is not required, Discouraged: Kelishites from the Paddisha Empire (especially Qadira)</li>
          <li>Race: Restricted (in order from most to least common): Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Elf, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Fetchling, Gillman, Aasimar, Tiefling, Ifrit, Oread, Suli, Slyph, Undine, Dhampir, Chanfeling, Skinwalker, Tengu, Vishkanya, Ratfolk, Catfolk, Kobold, Hobgoblin. Only one of the final four races can be played at a time. Human or race with pass-as-human trait recommended. Humans and part-human races level after only 8 hours of rest.</li>
          <li>Religion: No restrictions, Patheon: Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Norgorber, and Shelyn, Tributary Worship: Aroden, Calistria, Diabolism, Green Faith, Iomedae, and Kurgess, Urgathoa, Taboo: Sarenrae</li>
          <li>Campaign Feats:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Racial (Human) Feat Azlanti-Heritage:  distant descendent of the ancient Azlanti, your lineage is rich with the dust of empires spanning all of human history, and the apex of human potential runs through your veins. Prerequisites: Human, must be taken at 1st level. Benefit: You gain a +2 racial bonus to an additional ability score (this cannot be one already increased by your existing racial bonus). At 8th and 16th level, you may raise two ability scores by 1 instead of only one ability score. In addition, the time it takes to perform any mundane downtime task (including crafting, performing, retraining, and resting) is reduced by 20%, and the time required to complete any magical downtime task (including learning and preparing spells, and magical crafting) is reduced by 50%. This only reduces the time required, it does not increase the amount that can be done. A character with a magical bloodline (like sorcerers) must choose the Imperious Bloodline.</li>
              <li>Variant Feat: Leadership: You have a knack for attracting others to your cause. Prerequisites: Character level 7th. Benefit: You gain a cohort as described in the Leadership feat. Determine your leadership score as described in the feat’s text but with the following exceptions: Instead of adding your	Charisma modifier to your character’s level to determine your	base leadership score, the Rank of any facet of your persona. Additionally, you can direct your cohort to send agents on an operation, instead of accompanying you. If you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on your Operation check, but your cohort is unavailable until the beginning of the next persona phase. Finally, you do not gain followers as listed in the Leadership feat. Instead, you can perform the recover agent operation once per persona phase; this does not count as an operation.</li>
              <li>Variant Feat Noble Scion: You are a member of one of the significant noble families of Oppara, whether or not you remain in good standing with your family. In many cases, these families are Imperialists loyal to Maxillar Pythareus, and as such you either are a black sheep or your family has cut you off entirely. Prerequisites: Cha 13 or Child of Oppara, must be taken at 1st level. Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
        <p>Players must choose one of these traits upon character creation:</p>
        <li>Athletic Champion: Your physique and skill brought you into the public eye, and a winning smile helps you stay there. Taldor honors its extraordinary athletes, celebrating them as cultural heroes. Whether you were a gladiator, a runner, a wrestler, or any other competitor, your most recent victory caused someone important to sit up and take notice. You may never have a political career in front of you, but for now your name is helping to bring a little extra money in, and maybe that’s good enough. Select two of the following skills: Climb, Diplomacy, Perception, and Swim. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with those skills, and they are always class skills for you. In addition, you are accustomed to maneuvering through crowds; you gain a +2 trait bonus on checks to navigate through a crowd or resist being moved against your will, including spells and bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers. </li>
        <li>Child of Oppara: You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city’s well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia’s efforts to provide for Taldor’s common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in Aroden’s View or Senate’s Hill. If you want to be a member of one of Oppara’s major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Knowledge (nobility) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble’s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. </li>
        <li>Disgraced Noble: Your noble family used to matter, until your father took a stand against Maxillar Pythareus, the commander of Taldor’s military. True or not, the accusations Pythareus leveled against your family in return destroyed your reputation and isolated you from the society you grew up in. Now the only thing that matters to you is clawing your way back up the social ladder, either for your own quality of life or to clear your family’s name. You’ve had to practice deception as you began working your way back into Taldan social circles; you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to conceal your identity and a +2 bonus on Linguistics checks to spot or produce forgeries, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can choose a single humanoid you believe to have been involved in the conspiracy to destroy your family; you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that NPC for a number of rounds equal to your character level. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2.</li>
        <li>Rising Star: All too often, great minds must suffer for their art, but you’re one of the lucky ones. Your skills attracted the attention of a noble patron who pays for your food, housing, and tools. As your patron introduces you to other cultural elites, you’re slowly learning to navigate the treacherous waters of high society, but you still remember the lean times when each meal was a hard-won treasure. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive and Survival checks, as well as checks using a single Craft or Perform skill of your choice; one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can invoke your patron’s reputation or name one of your own prominent works to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on a single Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check. You begin the game with a masterwork musical instrument or tool appropriate to the Craft or Perform skill you selected, a gift from your patron.</li>
        <li>Senatorial Hopeful: While you belong to a noble family, hailing from the outlying prefectures means you lack the pull and wealth needed to rub shoulders with the stars of Oppara’s social scene. Your life has been quiet, isolated from the thrum of fashion and pop culture, but you see this as a source of insight and aim to help people by someday joining the senate. It’ll be a long journey, but you’ve already begun learning which hands to shake and how to listen carefully when others tell you what they want. You gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks, and both of these skills are always class skills for you. Once each week you can call on family connections to obtain a single piece of equipment or consumable magic item (such as a potion or scroll) worth up to your character level × 25 gp. Delivery of the goods you request takes 1d4 days. At 10th level, the potential value of a magical item increases to your character level × 50 gp, and your requests can also include spellcasting services and wands.</li>
        <li>Taldan Patriot: You love your country, its history, and its people... even though they may not love you back. Whether you’re a bureaucrat, a minor noble, or a soldier, you want your community to be the best it can be and you channel that love into a position in service to the people of Taldor. You gain a +1 bonus on all Sense Motive and Knowledge (history) checks, and these skills are always class skills for you. In addition, once per day you can recall a specific fact about a Taldan noble’s personality—quirks such as a hobby or pet peeve— including information you would normally learn as a discovery check in social combat.</li>
        <li>Toung Reformer: Perhaps you were born at the bottom of Taldan society and you’re tired of seeing your friends and family toil endlessly with no hope of a better life, or maybe your privileged outlook was shattered by empathy or tragedy. Either way, you know the system is broken, and you’ve dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have… so far. You’ve got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you’ll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have “made arrangements” on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make—for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find—must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you’re a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don’t have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival.</li>

          <li>Varima: This family immigrated to Taldor from Vudra centuries ago, and thanks to noble roots, extensive trade contacts, and an unparalleled skill in negotiation, soon developed into a steadfast fixture of Oppara’s social scene</li>
          <li>Vernisant: This family is descended from the great general Arnisant, who commanded Taldan forces during the Shining Crusade... and they will never let anyone forget it!</li>
          <li>Vinmark: Newcomers and outsiders, this Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted their family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard</li>
          <li>Zespire: This family runs charities and lobbies heavily for social reform, leaving them with few friends among their Opparan peers but heartfelt support from the common folk and lesser nobility, Allies: House Heskillar, Enemies: House Merrosett, Family Story Feat: Lighting the Way</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>Minor Noble Houses: A player with any campaign trait may choose to play as a member of one of these noble houses:</p>

          <li>Denzarni: House Denzarni traces its origin back to the union of Grand Prince Urios II’s daughter and the heir of a tribal leader who claimed Azlanti descent, Allies: Merrosett, Enemies: Fahlspar, Family Story Feat: Our Bounty, Our Glory</li>
          <li>Ennoi: This family of "Andoren Sympathizers" has long fallen from their former lofty places</li>
          <li>Fahlspar: House Fahlspar is one of the earliest established noble houses and was named after its founder, the leader of a small tribe of Kellid hunters and druids, Allies: Corcina, Enemies: Denzarni, Family Story Feat: Standing Tall</li>
          <li>Heskillar: In a nation where dragon-slaying has a proud tradition - and where memories of the devastating Dragon Plague still linger - House Heskillar remains curiously insistent that one of its earliest ancestors was a great bronze dragon, Allies: Zespire, Enemies: Darahan, Family Story Feat: Never Conquered, Forever Feared</li>
          <li>Lawsus: This family recently bought their way into minor nobility, with the current family head's father being born the son of a mere wealthy bussinessman</li>

          <li>Solari: Recently taking control of a grand duchy, the Solari family is highly manipulative and cunning</li>
          <li>Tiberan: A family of traders and pirate-hunters, House Tiberan controls the port-city of Cassomir and has the greatest trade reach, though they lack the familial numbers to wield major influence</li>
          <li>Vort: Controlling the critical heartland county of Lionsmane, located next to Meratt and between both Cassomir and Oppara, the vort family is responsible for securing much of the canals and highways between the two giant Cities</li>
          <li>Zellvyngian: This incredibly corrupt house of lesser nobles has risen to some minor prominence over the last dacade due to kickbacks from criminal land deals</li>
