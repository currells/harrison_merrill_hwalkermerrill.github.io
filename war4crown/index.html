        <h2>Campaign Feats</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Feats Special to this Campaign. It is also recommended that players look at Intrigue feats during their character design.</b>
          <li style="display: none;">Campaign-Specific Feats:
            <ol type="a">
              <li style="display: none;">Racial (Human) Feat Azlanti-Heritage:  distant descendent of the ancient Azlanti, your lineage is rich with the dust of empires spanning all of human history, and the apex of human potential runs through your veins. Prerequisites: Human, must be taken at 1st level. Benefit: You gain a +2 racial bonus to an additional ability score (this cannot be one already increased by your existing racial bonus). At 8th and 16th level, you may raise two ability scores by 1 instead of only one ability score. In addition, the time it takes to perform any mundane downtime task (including crafting, performing, retraining, and resting) is reduced by 20%, and the time required to complete any magical downtime task (including learning and preparing spells, and magical crafting) is reduced by 50%. This only reduces the time required, it does not increase the amount that can be done. A character with a magical bloodline (like sorcerers) must choose the Imperious Bloodline.</li>
              <li style="display: none;">Variant Feat (Noble Scion): Noble Scion: You are a member of one of the significant noble families of Oppara, whether or not you remain in good standing with your family. In many cases, these families are Imperialists loyal to Maxillar Pythareus, and as such you either are a black sheep or your family has cut you off entirely. Prerequisites: Cha 13 or Child of Oppara, must be taken at 1st level. Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. You also gain an additional benefit depending on which family you belong to.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li style="display: none;">Variant Leadership: These alternatives to leadership are available and recomended.
            <ol type="a">
              <li style="display: none;">Coalition Leader (Counts as Leadership): You have a knack for attracting others to your cause. Prerequisites: Character level 7th. Benefit: You gain a cohort as described in the Leadership feat. Determine your leadership score as described in the feat’s text but with the following exceptions: Instead of adding your	Charisma modifier to your character’s level to determine your	base leadership score, the Rank of any facet of your persona. Additionally, you can direct your cohort to send agents on an operation, instead of accompanying you. If you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on your Operation check, but your cohort is unavailable until the beginning of the next persona phase. Finally, you do not gain followers as listed in the Leadership feat. Instead, you can perform the recover agent operation once per persona phase; this does not count as an operation.</li>
              <li style="display: none;">Vile Leadership (Counts as Leadership): You rule over your own cabal of minions with a villainous cohort as your lieutenant. Prrequisites: Any evil alignment, character level 7th. Benefit: You can attract a loyal cohort and a number of intimidated followers to assist in your nefarious deeds. This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards—rather than punishes—leaders with cruel reputations or who cause their followers’ deaths. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection. Numerous factors can affect your Vile Leadership score (which acts as a Leadership score for the purpose of feats and abilities that rely on a Leadership score, other than Leadership itself); work in conjunction with your GM and use vile leadership tables to adjust your Vile Leadership score accordingly. The NPCs you attract must be of a nongood alignment. </li>
              <li style="display: none;">Groom (Upgrades to Leadership): You recruit a professional groom to care for your mount. Prerequisite: Character level 4th. Benefit: This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions to note. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a groom) with this feat, and cannot recruit followers of his own. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 129), but your groom is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A groom can take levels in bard, fighter, or ranger. A groom can’t multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies. A groom finds the best place to stable and conceal your mount and the mounts of up to five allies while you and your allies are elsewhere. A groom adds half his level (minimum 1) to Stealth checks when concealing himself and any mounts that are left in his care. A groom also gains the ability to speak with animals as a supernatural ability, but he can use this ability only with horses, riding dogs, and other mounts of the animal type. If a groom gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn’t gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you  advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your groom from service or otherwise lose your groom, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat.</li>
              <li style="display: none;">Light Bearer (Upgrades to Leadership): You recruit a torchbearer who joins you on your adventures to help illuminate even the darkest dungeons. Prerequisites: Character level 4th. Benefit: This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a light bearer) with this feat, and can’t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your light bearer is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A light bearer can take levels in alchemistAPG, fighter, or rogue. The light bearer cannot multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies. The radius of normal and increased illumination shed by whatever alchemical or mundane light source the light bearer carries increases by 10 feet. He also gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against an effect that would extinguish any nonmagical (including alchemical) light source he carries. If a light bearer gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn’t gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your light bearer from service or otherwise lose your light bearer, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat. </li>
              <li style="display: none;">Page (Upgrades to Leadership): You recruit a page who heralds your approach and has the ability to smooth the path of your diplomatic missions. Prerequisites: Character level 4th, proficiency with martial weapons. Benefits: This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a page) with this feat, and can’t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your page is always at least 3 levels lower than your level. A page can take levels in bard, cavalierAPG, or paladin. She cannot multiclass, though she can take any archetype for which she qualifies. Whenever a page tries to influence a creature’s attitude by using the Diplomacy skill, she can use her total Diplomacy skill bonus or yours. Any improvement of a creature’s attitude toward the page also applies to you. If a page gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn’t gain the new level until you gain your next level; until then, her XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance in level. If you release your page from service or otherwise lose your page, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat. </li>
              <li style="display: none;">Recruits (Upgrades to or Counts as Leadership): Be they students, retainers, new recruits to your order, or neophyte members of your faith, you have access to a small set of dedicated servants. Prerequisites: Cha 13, character level 5th. Benefit: You gain a number of cohorts (as per the Leadership feat) that represent NPCs you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these recruits must be at least 4 levels lower than your level. Since these recruits must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, only one recruit can travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and growing independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you can exchange the recruit currently accompanying you for a different member of your recruits. As recruits are busy learning and studying the basics of their careers, those not traveling with you can’t engage in mundane or magical crafting or Profession checks. Recruits not traveling with you can, however, serve as managers for your holdings if you are using the downtime rules (Ultimate Campaign 88). If a recruit dies, you take only a –1 penalty to your Leadership score. Special: The Recruits feat counts as the Leadership feat for purposes of fulfilling prerequisites. A character cannot have both Leadership and Recruits. A character with Recruits who later qualifies for Leadership can exchange this feat for Leadership immediately upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the rest move on).</li>
              <li style="display: none;">Weapon Bearer (Upgrades to Leadership): You attract a weapon bearer to aid you in your endeavors. Prerequisites: Character level 4th, proficient with all martial weapons. Benefits: This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a weapon bearer) with this feat, and can’t recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your weapon bearer is always at least 3 levels lower than yourself. A weapon bearer can take levels in only cavalierAPG, fighter, or gunslingerUC. She cannot multiclass, though she can take any archetype for which she qualifies. Once per round as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can retrieve an item carried by your weapon bearer. In addition, your weapon bearer can pick up items you drop as an immediate action. In order to use either of these abilities, you and your weapon bearer must be adjacent to each other and must both be able to move and communicate with each other. If a weapon bearer gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn’t gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, her XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level. If you release your weapon bearer from service or otherwise lose your weapon bearer, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat.</li>

        <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Trait Options: Players must choose ONE of these traits upon character creation:</b>
          <li style="display: none;">Athletic Champion: Your physique and skill brought you into the public eye, and a winning smile helps you stay there. Taldor honors its extraordinary athletes, celebrating them as cultural heroes. Whether you were a gladiator, a runner, a wrestler, or any other competitor, your most recent victory caused someone important to sit up and take notice. You may never have a political career in front of you, but for now your name is helping to bring a little extra money in, and maybe that’s good enough. Select two of the following skills: Climb, Diplomacy, Perception, and Swim. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with those skills, and they are always class skills for you. In addition, you are accustomed to maneuvering through crowds; you gain a +2 trait bonus on checks to navigate through a crowd or resist being moved against your will, including spells and bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers. </li>
          <li style="display: none;">Child of Oppara: You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city’s well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia’s efforts to provide for Taldor’s common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in Aroden’s View or Senate’s Hill. If you want to be a member of one of Oppara’s major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Knowledge (nobility) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble’s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. </li>
          <li style="display: none;">Disgraced Noble: Your noble family used to matter, until your father took a stand against Maxillar Pythareus, the commander of Taldor’s military. True or not, the accusations Pythareus leveled against your family in return destroyed your reputation and isolated you from the society you grew up in. Now the only thing that matters to you is clawing your way back up the social ladder, either for your own quality of life or to clear your family’s name. You’ve had to practice deception as you began working your way back into Taldan social circles; you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to conceal your identity and a +2 bonus on Linguistics checks to spot or produce forgeries, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can choose a single humanoid you believe to have been involved in the conspiracy to destroy your family; you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that NPC for a number of rounds equal to your character level. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2.</li>
          <li style="display: none;">Rising Star: All too often, great minds must suffer for their art, but you’re one of the lucky ones. Your skills attracted the attention of a noble patron who pays for your food, housing, and tools. As your patron introduces you to other cultural elites, you’re slowly learning to navigate the treacherous waters of high society, but you still remember the lean times when each meal was a hard-won treasure. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive and Survival checks, as well as checks using a single Craft or Perform skill of your choice; one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can invoke your patron’s reputation or name one of your own prominent works to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on a single Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check. You begin the game with a masterwork musical instrument or tool appropriate to the Craft or Perform skill you selected, a gift from your patron.</li>
          <li style="display: none;">Senatorial Hopeful: While you belong to a noble family, hailing from the outlying prefectures means you lack the pull and wealth needed to rub shoulders with the stars of Oppara’s social scene. Your life has been quiet, isolated from the thrum of fashion and pop culture, but you see this as a source of insight and aim to help people by someday joining the senate. It’ll be a long journey, but you’ve already begun learning which hands to shake and how to listen carefully when others tell you what they want. You gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks, and both of these skills are always class skills for you. Once each week you can call on family connections to obtain a single piece of equipment or consumable magic item (such as a potion or scroll) worth up to your character level × 25 gp. Delivery of the goods you request takes 1d4 days. At 10th level, the potential value of a magical item increases to your character level × 50 gp, and your requests can also include spellcasting services and wands.</li>
          <li style="display: none;">Taldan Patriot: You love your country, its history, and its people... even though they may not love you back. Whether you’re a bureaucrat, a minor noble, or a soldier, you want your community to be the best it can be and you channel that love into a position in service to the people of Taldor. You gain a +1 bonus on all Sense Motive and Knowledge (history) checks, and these skills are always class skills for you. In addition, once per day you can recall a specific fact about a Taldan noble’s personality—quirks such as a hobby or pet peeve— including information you would normally learn as a discovery check in social combat.</li>
          <li style="display: none;">Young Reformer: Perhaps you were born at the bottom of Taldan society and you’re tired of seeing your friends and family toil endlessly with no hope of a better life, or maybe your privileged outlook was shattered by empathy or tragedy. Either way, you know the system is broken, and you’ve dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have… so far. You’ve got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you’ll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have “made arrangements” on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make—for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find—must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you’re a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don’t have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival.</li>

        <h2>Taldan Noble Houses</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Taldan Major Noble Houses: Players must choose the Variant Noble Scion Feat to select one of these houses:</b>
          <li style="display: none;">Basri: This family comes from the long line of ambassadors, diplomats, and travelers that make up the Basri, and maintains the strongest ties to the elven nation of Kyonin of any Taldan house </li>
