        <h3>Soldiers Glory</h3>
        <img src="images/soldiers-glory.png" alt="Soldiers Glory">
        <p><i>Soldier's Glory</i> is the famous blade that once served Honaria Alcasti. While he mourned his wielder's death, he refused to be interred with her. Intelligent and honorable, he refuses to be wielded by those without a noble spirit, or speak to those without a courageous heart.</p>
        <p>While some of his powers have faded with history, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> is an intelligent (LG, CL7, 30ft. Sense, Ego +9, IWC 10-10-14, Speech-Common) <i>+2 benevolent longsword</i>. Wielders who are neither lawful nor good must make a will save equal to 2x his ego or drop the weapon immediately. <i>Soldiers Glory</i> can also cast <i>cure light wounds</i> 3/day and <i>aid</i> 1/day, but will not allow its wielder to dictate his spell usage unless they're Lawful Good. In the hands of a non-good non-lawful character, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> acts as a masterwork longsword.</p>
        <p>Reinvigorated by the tales of slaying the Iron Lash of Meratt, <i>Soldier's Glory's</i> wielder can attempt an aid-another action in combat with Soldier's Glory as a move action.</p>

        <h3>Brass Chatterbox</h3>
        <img src="images/chatterbox.png" alt="Brass Chatterbox">
        <p>This elegant clockwork cricket, molded from brass and darkwood with a key in its back, is a clever invention of Lady Martella Lotheed to deter eavesdropping.</p>
        <p>If wound as a full-round action, this elegant cricket clicks and chirps softly for 2 minutes. Though generally too subtle to be noticed, creatures within 5 feet of the chatterbox can hear one another without difficulty, but anyone further away takes a -5 penalty on their perception checks to hear sounds within 5 feet of the chatterbox. If placed on a door, the brass chatterbox instead applies a -10 penalty on checks to hear through the door.</p>
        <p>By making a DC20 craft (alchemy) check, a person can erase or record a message that is two minutes or shorter in length. When wound, the cricket will instead play the message, but the message cannot be heared from over 5 feet away. This still reduces eavesdropping, but has no effect on doors.</p>

        <h3>Mark of the Zimar Corsairs</h3>
        <img src="images/corsair-mark.png" alt="Zimar Corsair Mark">
        <p>This piece of silver looks and spends like any other one, but its been stamped by a Zimar Corsair Captain. With the corsairs on one side, and Captain Seferi's mark on the other, its easy to tell from whom this coin came.</p>
        <p>This mark is valid as long as the sponsoring captain is alive and in good standing with the Corsairs. Showing this mark to a corsair will tell them you have a captains favor, along with granting access to the grey market.</p>

        <h3>Dignity's Barb</h3>
        <img src="images/dignitys-barb.png" alt="Dignity's Barb">
        <p>Brass inlay and Taldan military symbols adorn fine wooden stock of this masterwork darkwood light crossbow. The polished stock feels slightly warm to the touch when held. An golden inscription bears the name of General Gerefein of the Seventh Army of Exploration. In his most famous act, the general turned the tide of a prolonged and vicious battle with a canny Kellid warlord. Through the driving snow of a chaotic blizzard, General Gerefein shot practically blind, yet his bolt struck a lethal blow, dashing the warlord from his mount. As the Kellid soldiers watched their leader fall, they broke their charge, leaving General Gerefein the victor on that day. </p>
        <p><i>Dignity's Barb</i> is a masterwork darkwood light crossbow. The crossbow gives its wielder a touch of the luck that bore the general to great victories. Anyone firing <i>Dignity’s Barb</i> reduces miss chances from concealment by 5%. </p>

        <h3>Envoy Ring</h3>
        <img src="images/envoy-ring.png" alt="Envoy Ring">
        <p>This golden ring appears pristine on the outside, but the inside shows centuries of wear, leaving the inner band perpetually polished to a lighter hue than that of the ring’s outer surfaces. A family crest adorns the front, depicting olive branches encircling two crowns, seemingly indicating a house dedicated to ambassadorship and diplomacy. It has been adjusted into a unique-looking signet ring.</p>
        <p>The ring grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Linguistics, and Perform checks. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to transform their appearance and clothing, as a CL3 <i>disguise self</i>. The appearance of their clothing automatically matches the customs of the dominant culture around them, typically that of the local nobility or ruling class. Their physical features don’t match those of the local people, but features that would make them stand out - such as elf ears in a settlement where no elves live - diminish. This lasts up to 24 hours but can be dismissed at any time.</p>
        <p>Reinvigorated since winning hearts at the Tanager Jubilee, the ring can also be used to cast a CL3 <i>Comprehend languages</i> and <i>charm person</i> (DC16) once a day each.</p>

        <h3>Styx Oil</h3>
        <img src="images/styx-oil.png" alt="Styx Oil">
        <p>Styx oil is a carefully distilled combination of antitoxin, bloodroot, id moss, and various mushrooms. Styx oil renders its target unconscious and floods every sense with erratic hallucinations, overwhelming the mind and essentially wiping away memories.</p>
        <p>This chaotic mélange wipes away memories of the 5 minutes prior to the poison’s injection; occasionally, though, the drug fails to paralyze its victim, leaving the creature to flail violently and unpredictably in response to the hallucinations. If Styx oil is delivered by a weapon rather than injection or other subtle method, the victim gains a +5 circumstance bonus to resist the memory-erasing properties of the poison. </p>
        <p>Type: poison, injury; Save: Fortitude DC16; Frequency: 1/minute for 2 minutes; Initial Effect: unconscious for 1d4 minutes; Secondary Effect: confusion for 2d6 rounds; Cure: 2 saves</p>
