        <h3>Godspike</h3>
        <img src="images/godspike.png" alt="Godspike">
        <p>The weapon of choice for Marjorine Sandaris, this silver spear was created as a divine weapon for the shinning crusade. Legend says the spear cut down several cursed beasts, vile cultists, and horrific undead, including the many of the first ghoul spawn, though not before its bearer was afflicted by the cursed disease and had her face burned away. Marjorine was burried with this spear in a warded tomb, though she apparently rose again once the cannal waters flooded her grave and washed the wards away.</p>
        <p>The <i>Godspike</i> is a <i>+2 holy ghost-touch spear</i> made from hardened silver and encrusted with agate stones. One third of the spear is engraved with holy symbols and prayers to Arazni from before she was turned into the Harlot Queen. One third of the Spear is engraved with holy symbols and prayers to Aroden. One third is blank.</p>
        <!--<p>Fully restored, becomes +3 holy ghost touch undead bane.</p>-->

        <h3>Red Reaper</h3>
        <img src="images/red-reaper.png" alt="Red Reaper">
        <p>The weapon created for Xan, the trusted Vanth Psychopomp in service to Pharasma, Lady of Graves. With the freedom to hunt targets of his own choosing, Xan had been using the <i>Red Reaper</i> to reap escaping souls on Golarion since before the Starfall.</p>
        <p>The <i>Red Reaper</i> is a <i>+1 conductive mithral scythe</i> that counts as a Holy Symbol of Pharasma. A living creature slain or an undead destroyed by the <i>Red Reaper</i> cannot be returned to life, animated, or reanimated by any means except by a miracle or wish, and their soul is immediately sent to the boneyard if (it was attached to the creature when destroyed) to be judged, regardless of any prior claims upon the soul. When wielded by someone wearing <i>Xan's Mask</i> (which is otherwise non-magical and takes up both the eyes and head/mask slot), the wielder gains the Spirit Touch and Spiritsense (60ft.) abilities of a psychopomp. The creature wearing the <i>Xan's Mask</i> can also summon or dismiss the <i>Red Reaper</i> from its own personal demiplane as a free action. If the <i>Red Reaper</i> is destroyed, it reforms in its personal demiplane in 24 hours.</p>

    <h2>Relics and Storied Magical Items</h2>
    <p>Relics Profile: According to our sources, Relics are powered by Taldan Zeitgeist, using their long history and the stories told about them to enhance their magic. For Relics to reach their full potential, stories must continue to be told and memories must be kept fresh. For this to happen, the Relic must be wielded, worn, or carried when doing something worth telling stories about, simply being owned or stored by someone noteworthy is not enough.</p>

        <h3>Soldiers Glory</h3>
        <img src="images/soldiers-glory.png" alt="Soldiers Glory">
        <p><i>Soldier's Glory</i> is the famous blade that once served Honaria Alcasti. While he mourned his wielder's death, he refused to be interred with her. Intelligent and honorable, he refuses to be wielded by those without a noble spirit or speak to those without a courageous heart.</p>
        <p>While some of his powers have faded with history, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> is an intelligent (LG, CL12, Senses [30 ft.], Ego +18, IWC 10-13-13, Empathy & Speech - Common) <i>+4 benevolent longsword</i>. Wielders who are neither lawful nor good must make a will save equal to 2x his ego or drop the weapon immediately. <i>Soldiers Glory</i> can also cast <i>cure critical wounds</i> 3/day and <i>aid</i> 1/day, but will not allow its wielder to dictate his spell usage unless they're Lawful Good. In the hands of a non-good non-lawful character, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> acts as a masterwork longsword. Evil characters gain one temporary negative level while wielding <i>Soldier's Glory</i> which cannot be overcome in any way (including spells) but is immediately restored once <i>Soldier's Glory</i> is no longer being wielded.</p>
        <p>Reinvigorated by the tales of slaying the Iron Lash of Meratt, <i>Soldier's Glory's</i> wielder can attempt an aid-another action in combat with Soldier's Glory as a move action.</p>
        <p>Empowered by taking the Palace of Birdsong, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> grants his wielder the alertness feat while being actively wielded.</p>
        <p>Empowered by rescuing the Twilight Child, 1/day <i>Soldier's Glory</i> can teleport itself into the hand of its last wielder.</p>
        <p>Empowered by the rumors surrounding the Kithrodian Academy, <i>Soldier's Glory</i> has achieved his maximum potential and regained his affinity for the sky. 1/day <i>Soldier's Glory</i> can cast <i>Fly</i> on his wielder with a fly speed of 120ft. with average maneuverability for 12 minutes.</p>

        <h3>The Natural Lab of Dumos Fatomax</h3>
        <img src="images/dumos-lab.png" alt="Dumos Fatomax Laboratory">
        <p>The natural philosopher Dumos Fatomax believed that the powers of druids and witches could be harnessed by science and used to heal the world. He kept careful notation on the alchemical properties of a variety of herbs, and designed his own laboratory instruments to utilize green-faith techniques.</p>
        <p>This portable alchemy lab grants a +1 competence bonus to Knowledge (Nature) checks made when consulting the lab as a standard action and does not provide a competence bonus to Craft (Alchemy). A user may use Knowledge (Nature) in place of Craft (alchemy) and Profession (herbalist) checks while using this lab, or in place of spellcraft while making potions. This lab also allows a user to identify potions using Knowledge (Nature) even without using spells like <i>Detect Magic</i> or <i>Identify</i>.</p>
        <!-- <p>The labs competence bonus increases to +2 and can be consulted to use Knowledge (nature) instead of Heal and Survival in addition to its other uses. When used in this manner, it counts as a healers kit and a compass, and does not stack with other healers kits, compasses, or similar items. While it does not and cannot hold any charges, when charges are needed for the healers kit, a character using the lab can use a potion or extract of equal level to the number of charges needed. The potion or extract is consumed in this process.</p>
        <p>The labs competence bonus increases to +3 and gains the ability to extract the magic from potions. If a creature using the lab has the inspiration class feature, they can use inspiration on Knowledge (nature) checks without expending a use of inspiration. Any creature with the alchemy class feature can use the lab to learn any spell on the alchemists formulae list to their formula book from a potion or oil. They may also use the lab to learn any extract from the druid, witch, or ranger spell lists with a range of touch from a potion or oil. When learning spells from a potion or oil, the potion or oil is consumed in the process.</p>
        <p>The labs competence bonus increases to +4 and can extract magic from potions or oils on the druid, ranger, shaman, and witch spell lists with a range of close or touch. Any creature using the lab counts as though they posses the Brew Potion feat. If they already have the Brew Potion feat, they can make a potion woth less than 1,000gp in 1 hour and any potion worth more than 1,000gp in 8 hours.</p>
        <p>The labs competence bonus increases to +5 and can extract magic from potions or oils on the druid, ranger, shaman, and witch spell lists with a range of medium, close, or touch. The lab can now also create healing solutions as a full-round action. By combining two potions or extracts of the same level, they can create a healing solution of the same level as the potions or extracts used. Healing solutions act as either <i>Cure Light Wounds, Cure Moderate Wounds, Cure Serious Wounds, Cure Critical Wounds,</i> or <i>Breath of Life</i> depending on its level. A healing solution created in this manner acts as an infused extract, with solutions made from potions being permanent, and solutions made from extracts lasting for 1 minute or until consumed before becoming magically inert.</p>
        <p>The lab reaches its maximum potential and fulfills the dreams of its original creator. It can extract magic from potions or oils on the druid, ranger, shaman, and witch spell lists of any range or level. A druid, ranger, shaman, witch, or creature with the Alchemy class feature can use the lab as a full round action to create an infused extract lasting from one minute or until consumed from any of their spells or extracts. Creating an infused extract in this manner consumes the spell or extract used to create it. It can also make <i>Reincarnate</i> healing solutions by expending 5th level extracts and oils worth 1,000gp and <i>Raise Dead</i> healing solutions by expending 6th level extracts and oils worth 5,000gp</p>-->

        <h3>Dignity's Barb</h3>
        <img src="images/dignitys-barb.png" alt="Dignity's Barb">
        <p>Brass inlay and Taldan military symbols adorn fine wooden stock of this <i>+1 darkwood light crossbow</i>. The polished stock feels slightly warm to the touch when held. A golden inscription bears the name of General Gerefein of the Seventh Army of Exploration. In his most famous act, the general turned the tide of a prolonged and vicious battle with a canny Kellid warlord. Through the driving snow of a chaotic blizzard, General Gerefein shot practically blind, yet his bolt struck a lethal blow, dashing the warlord from his mount. As the Kellid soldiers watched their leader fall, they broke their charge, leaving General Gerefein the victor on that day. </p>
        <p><i>Dignity's Barb</i> is a <i>+2 seeking darkwood light crossbow.</i> The crossbow gives its wielder a touch of the luck that bore the general to great victories. Anyone firing <i>Dignity’s Barb</i> reduces miss chances from concealment by 10%.</p>
        <p>Reinvigorated since destroying the teleportation circle at the Palace of Birdsong, 2/day when <i>Dignity's Barb</i> threatens a critical hit, the wielder can roll the confirmation check twice and take the better result.</p>
        <p>Empowered by rescuing the Twilight Child, <i>Dignity's Barb</i> gained the <i>seeking</i> quality</p>
        <p>Empowered by the rumors surrouding the Kithrodian Academy, <i>Dignity's Barb</i> gained the ability to attempt a lucky shot 1/day. When  a ranged weapon attack targets a creature within 30 feet of the wielder, the wielder can shoot <i>Dignity's Barb</i> at the projectile as an immediate action by rolling a ranged attack. If the result exceeds the attacker's roll, that attack is negated. This ability can only be used if <i>Dignity's Barb</i> is loaded or the wielder can use Rapid Reload or a similar ability.</p>
        <!--<p>*****, <i>Dignity's Barb</i> became +3 and can roll twice to confirm all critical hits.</p>
        <p>*****, <i>Dignity's Barb</i> reached its maximum potential and became +4. At the start of each day, the crossbow's owner rolls a d20, rerolling any results of 1, 19, or 20 and recording the final result. For the rest of that day, when the owners rolls the recorded number on an attack roll with <i>Dignity's Barb</i>, the attack roll is a critical threat. This has no benefit for anyone other than the owner who rolled at the start of the day.</p>

        <h3>Envoy Ring</h3>
        <img src="images/envoy-ring.png" alt="Envoy Ring">
        <p>This golden ring appears pristine on the outside, but the inside shows centuries of wear, leaving the inner band perpetually polished to a lighter hue than that of the ring’s outer surfaces. A family crest adorns the front, depicting olive branches encircling two crowns, seemingly indicating a house dedicated to ambassadorship and diplomacy. It has been adjusted into a unique-looking signet ring.</p>
        <p>The ring grants its wearer a +3 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Linguistics, and Perform checks. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to transform their appearance and clothing, as a CL3 <i>disguise self</i>. The appearance of their clothing automatically matches the customs of the dominant culture around them, typically that of the local nobility or ruling class. Their physical features don’t match those of the local people but features that would make them stand out - such as elf ears in a settlement where no elves live - diminish. This lasts up to 24 hours but can be dismissed at any time.</p>
        <p>Reinvigorated since winning hearts at the Tanager Jubilee, the ring can also be used to cast a CL3 <i>Comprehend languages</i> 1/day and <i>charm person</i> (DC17) at will, though if a creature makes its save it can't be targeted again for 24 huors.</p>
        <p>Empowered since the capture of the Palace of Birdsong, whenever the wearer activates the ring's <i>disguise</i>, they can read, speak, and understand the most common language in the area that they don't already know for as long as the duration persists.</p>
        <p>Empowered by rescuing the Twilight Child, the wearer can cast <i>charm monster</i> (DC20) 1/day.</p>
        <!--<p>*****The competence bonus increases to +5</p>
        <p>*****The wearer can use <i>mass suggestion</i> (DC24) once per day.</p>-->

        <h3>Koriana's Blade</h3>
        <img src="images/korianas-blade.png" alt="Koriana's Blade">
        <p>When the brave knight-commander Koriana of Zimar fell within the ranks of the Fifth Army of Exploration, her remains were returned home—along with her sundered steel shield. Her brother Tadric, distraught, focused only on creating a fitting legacy for Koriana’s daughter. Devoting himself to the study of metalcraft and magical crafting, he eventually turned a shard of his sister’s shield into a protective dagger. Though records indicate that Tadric’s niece took up the sword and joined the military, her full tale and the blade’s fate were lost to history. Rumors that she went into clandestine service for the royal family still circulate. </p>
        <p><i>Koriana’s Blade</i> is a <i>+3 defending dueling dagger.</i> It’s strangely curved, betraying its origins, and has five gemstones in its pommel. When the wielder transfers at least 1 point of the weapon’s enhancement bonus to her AC using the defending special ability, she also chooses one creature other than herself within 10 feet to gain a +1 bonus to AC until the wielder’s next turn. This bonus is always +1, regardless of how much of the weapon’s bonus the wielder transfers to her AC.</p>
        <p>Of its original five gemstones, the white gem in the center is intact. Once per day, the wielder can trigger this gemstone as an immediate action to absorb and negate all darts targeting them from a <i>magic missile</i> spell.</p>
        <p>Empowered since reclaiming the Palace of Birdsong, the pink gem on the hilt repaird itself and can be activated once per day as an immediate action to absorb and negate one mind-affecting effect targeting them.</p>
        <p>Empowered by rescuing the Twilight Child, the green gem repaired itself and can be activated once per day as an immediate action to absorb and negate one poison effect targeting them.</p>
        <p>Empowered by the rumors surrounding the Kithrodian Academy, <i>Koriana's Blade</i> now grants a +1 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects corresponding to one of its functioning gems. Also, the black gem repaired itself and can be activated once per day as an immediate action to absorb and negate one negative energy effect targeting them.</p>
        <!--<p>***** <i>Koriana’s Blade</i> reached its maximum potential and became +4 and the red gem repaired itself and can be activated once per day as an immediate action to absorb and negate one fire energy effect targeting them.</p>-->

        <h3>Subtle Mask</h3>
        <img src="images/subtle-mask.png" alt="Subtle Mask">
        <p>Fashioned to surround the wearer’s eyes and cover the forehead and cheekbones, this mask is made of porcelain inset with blue and green gems and decorated with golden filigree. When donned, the mask seems to disappear, leaving its golden patterns as tattoos on the wearer’s face and coloring one of the wearer’s eyes green and the other blue. The wearer can remove the mask normally, causing it to appear as a porcelain mask once again. </p>
        <p>The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks and can use comprehend languages once per day.</p>
        <p>Empowered since claiming the Palace of Birdsong as a home, the wearer of the <i>Subtle Mask</i> can activate it as a swift action while conversing with someone or observing a conversation to <i>detect surface thoughts</i> (DC17) on a single participant in the conversation. This requires spending the normal number of rounds to detect surface thoughts and can be used for a total of 9 rounds per day, which do not need to be consecutive.</p>
        <p>Empowered since rescuing the Twilight Child, the mask also detects magical effects as if using <i>arcane sight</i> while activating the mask. It also grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.</p>
        <p>Empowered by the rumors surrounding the Kithrodian Academy, the mask's enhancement bonus increased to +4.</p>
        <!--<p>The mask reached its full potential and its enhancement bonus increased to +6. When the wearer acticates the mask, they also detects if the target is lying as per <i>discern lies</i> (DC22). 1/day, the wearer can speak a command word to use <i>true seeing</i>.</p>-->

        <h3>Scion's Dagger</h3>
        <img src="images/scions-dagger.png" alt="Scion's Dagger">
        <p>This elegant, jeweled blade looks ornamental, but it is just as vicious as any weapon. A large black sapphire glitters in the dagger’s pommel, and the delicate work along the blade’s handle shows amazing artistry. The dagger was forged by Grand Prince Penticus IV to protect his son from a deal he struck with strange outsiders—trading his firstborn in order to win the crown. But Penticus V used the blade to take his own life, denying his father's benefactors their prize and securing the throne for his brother, Tralian V.</p>
        <p><i>Scion's Dagger</i> is a <i>+3 ghost touch mithral dagger</i>. As a full-round action, the dagger’s owner can designate up to four willing creatures in their presence as their bodyguards. As a standard action, each of these creatures can determine the owner’s location and condition, as per <i>status</i>, as long as the owner is holding the blade. The dagger’s owner can change the designated bodyguards as a full-round action, with each chosen creature beyond four replacing a prior choice.</p>
        <p>If the owner of <i> Scion's Dagger</i> dies while carrying or wielding the blade, their body evaporates into smoke and their soul transfers into the black sapphire as per <i>Soul Bind</i>, except anyone holding the dagger can attempt to raise them as though they has access to their intact body. This effect fails if a soul already occupies the gem. Alternatively, a creature holding the dagger can instead speak a command word to release the trapped soul into the afterlife.</p>
        <p>***** 1/day, the dagger's wielder can teleport any number of their bodyguards to their location as per <i>teleport</i>. They must be willing and within 100 miles, and when they arrive, they appear within 20 feet of the dagger's wielder in unnocupied spaces chosen by the GM.</p>
        <p>***** becomes +4. 1/day as a swift action, the wielder can gain DR 1/- and fast healing 3 for 1 minute.</p>
        <p>***** becomes +5. When the wielder hits a humanoid with the dagger, they can activate the dagger as an immediate action to use <i>dominate person</i> (DC23) on the creature for 1 round. The target is immune to subsequent uses of this effect for 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Standard of Conquest</h3>
        <img src="images/standard-conquest.png" alt="Standard of Conquest">
        <p>This meticulously woven flag depicts a horse and an elephant, both about to charge. The tapestry’s green and blue colors underscore the beasts’ connection to Taldor’s distinguished cavalry, the Taldan Horse, in which they have long been the most commonly used mounts. Though this particular piece of heraldry is rather rare in all reaches of the empire, those who know their Taldan military history know that this banner’s design has been used for hundreds of years.</p>
        <p>The following effects apply only if the standard is wielded or carried, and it must be attached to the shaft of a lance, polearm, spear, staff, or similar. The standard-bearer and all allies within 60 feet who can see the banner gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws. They also increase their base speed or fly speed and the base speed or fly speed of mounts they ride by 5 feet. This is treated as an enhancement bonus and doesn’t give a creature a base speed or fly speed if it didn’t have one already. A creature determines whether it can see the banner for the purposes of speed increase at the start of its turn, and it keeps the extra speed even if it moves out of sight later in that turn.</p>
        <p>1/day day when the wielder begins a charge action, the standard bearer can use a swift action to call for a battle charge, causing the speed increase from the standard to become 20 feet for 1 round. Any affected creature that charges during this round also ignores the penalty to AC from its charge.</p>
        <p>Empowered by rescuing the Twilight Child, 1/day the standard bearer can now activate the banner to teleport themselves and up to five allies who are within 10 feet of them. This functions as <i>dimension door</i>, and each transported creture must arrive within 10 feet of the <i>standard of conquest.</i></p>
        <p>Empowered by the rumors surrounding the Kithrodian Academy, the standard bearer can now call for a battle charge 2/day and each creature affected gains a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability for 1 minute.</p>
        <!--<p>***** The <i>Standard of Conquest</i> reached its maximum potential. The standard bearer and allies within 60 feet who can see the standard gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls. When the standard bearer calls for a battle charge, each affected creature is also affected by <i>greater heroism</i> with a duration of 1 minute.</p>-->

        <h3>Band of the Crusaders' Alliance</h3>
        <img src="images/crusaders-alliance.png" alt="Band of the Crusaders' Alliance">
        <p>Stylistic flourishes and a stout design suggest dwarves had a hand in forging this thick ring. The precise engineering of the small moving parts shows the fine artistry that went into creating the item. The ring features two carved symbols that flank a faceted onyx: one resembles the flag of Taldor, and the other depicts the eye of Aroden. Each of these three elements can be activated once per day to use a certain spell: the Taldan flag for <i>hold person</i> (DC13), the eye of Aroden for <i>prayer</i>, and the onyx for <i>stone shape</i>.</p>
        <p>Encircling the ring is a second metal band that rotates in place and is studded with a single diamond. If the diamond is aligned with one of the symbols, the wearer gains a +2 luck bonus on certain saving throws: saves against enchantment spells and spell-like abilities if aligned with the Taldan flag, against evil effects if aligned with the eye of Aroden, or against earth and poison effects if aligned with the onyx. Aligning the ring with a symbol is a fullround action.</p>
        <p>***** Each element can be activated one additional time each day to use a different spell: the Taldan flag for <i>sending</i>, the eye of Aroden for <i>death ward</i>, and the onyx for <i>wall of stone.</i></p>
        <p>***** Each element can be activated one additional time each day to use a different spell: the Taldan flag for <i>mass suggestion</i>, the eye of Aroden for <i>disrupting weapon</i>, and the onyx for <i>ransmute rock to mud</i>.</p>

        <h3>The Broken Dagger of Amalon</h3>
        <img src="images/broken-amalon.png" alt="Broken Dagger of Amalon">
        <p>This broken dagger has a horse-head pommel, a symbol commonly associated with House Pythareus. The tip has broken off but still floats suspended near its original location, as though bound there by a supernatural will. Anyone holding the dagger knows instinctively how many human lives the knife has ended and can feel both the anger of the murdered and the bloodlust of the knife.</p>
        <p>The <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> is a broken intelligent (N, Senses [30 ft.], Ego +4, IWC 10-10-10, Empathy - Common, Purpose - Slay Humans) <i>+1 Human-Bane Dagger</i> with a human-kill-count of: 1. Unlike ordinary broken items, the <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> cannot be repaired beyond half its ordinary hp and can never have the broken condition removed, though is also cannot be destroyed except under a specific set of conditions, though it is rendered temporarily inert when it would ordinarily be destroyed until it is repaired to half its ordinary number of hit points. The <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> grants a free sunder attempt on any targets armor when dealing critical or precision damage. Sunder attempts granted in this manner do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
        <p>gains menacing special ability and +2 ego. When using the <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> to attack Humans, creatures wielding the dagger count as a rougue two levels higher for the purpose of dealing sneak attack damage. This grants the sneak attack ability as a second level rogue to creatures that do not ordinarily deal sneak attack damage while attacking humans.</p>
        <p>gains heartseeking special ability and +4 ego. When using the <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i>, the wielder is considerd to have the Armor Piercer rogue talent and the Improved Sunder feat. When using the <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> to attack Humans, creatures wielding the dagger count as a ranger five levels higher for the purpose of dealing favored enemy damage. This grants the favored enemy (human) ability as a first level ranger to creatures that do have favored enemy (human) while tracking, interacting with, or attacking humans. If the dagger is not used by its wielder to slay a human for 24 hours it becomes magically inert (only for that wielder) until they show their obedience by pricking their finger with the blade tip, dealing full sneak attack damage. Performing this obedience counts as a minor act opposing the wielders alignment (evil if good, good if evil, chaotic if lawful, lawful if chaotic, chaotic evil if lawful good, etc.).</p>
        <p>becomes +2, ego +8. The <i>Broken Dagger of Amalon</i> reached its maximum potential and no longer distinguises between living and undead humans or half-humans. Half-humans and undead created from humans or half-humans are treated as human by the blade, including all of the blades weapon enhancements and abilities. This also negates any immunities of those half-humans or undead to flanking, sunder, sneak attack, and critical hits granted by their creature type, race, or templates (but not by their class or magic items). Destroying or slaying a creature that counts as human also counts for the blades obedience requirement. The blade also bypasses any racial or alignment Damage Resistance possessed by humans or those considered human by the blade, and the blades wielder is considered to be of Nuetral aligment for the purpose of spells or supernatural abilities of humans or creatures the blade considers human. The blade grants the sneak attack ability as a third level rogue and favored enemy (human) as a fifth level ranger while tracking, interacting with, or attacking humans (or creatures that count as human to the blade) to creatures without those abilities.</p>

        <h3>Ovetrian's Plate</h3>
        <img src="images/ovetrians-plate.png" alt="Ovetrian's Plate">
        <p>This stories suit of <i>+3 rallying full plate</i> was worn by General Ovetrian over the course of many conquests. It was recorded that General Ovetrian wore this armor when he was a part of the Fifth Army of Exploration, where he led a group into the River Kingdoms and places east. Plated in platinum with a slight wave pattern, the armor’s surface bears a resemblance to white fur. The armor’s visor is fashioned to look like a male lion’s maned head, and it is hinged so it can be either worn up or pulled down to protect the face. Stories of the general’s battles claim that entire lines of soldiers fled from the general when he rode into battle.</p>
        <p>Once every 10 minutes, the armor’s wearer can slam the helm’s visor shut as a standard action, exposing the lion’shead design. When he does, he can attempt to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet, and he gains a competence bonus on his Intimidate check equal to the armor’s enhancement bonus to AC. Once per day, instead of attempting to demoralize enemies, he can take this action to afflict all creatures within 30 feet with <i>fear</i> (DC20).</p>
        <p>***** becomes +4 rallying full plate. A creature demoralized by the armor’s ability is frightened for the first round of the effect’s duration and is then shaken as normal for the rest of the duration (if any). Three times per day, the wearer of the armor can touch an adjacent ally as a standard action to affect that ally with either <i>break enchantment</i> or <i>greater heroism</i>. This ability can’t be used more than once every 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>**** becomes +5 rallying full plate. When the wearer uses the armor’s ability to demoralize enemies, he gains a morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the number of creatures that were demoralized. He also gains damage reduction of the same amount, which can’t be overcome. These effects last for 1 round, but if the wearer successfully hits a foe suffering from a fear effect, the duration is extended by 1 round.</p>

        <h3>Brass Chatterbox</h3>
        <img src="images/chatterbox.png" alt="Brass Chatterbox">
        <p>This elegant clockwork cricket, molded from brass and darkwood with a key in its back, is a clever invention of Lady Martella Lotheed to deter eavesdropping.</p>
        <p>If wound as a full-round action, this elegant cricket clicks and chirps softly for 2 minutes. Though generally too subtle to be noticed, creatures within 5 feet of the chatterbox can hear one another without difficulty, but anyone further away takes a -5 penalty on their perception checks to hear sounds within 5 feet of the chatterbox. If placed on a door, the brass chatterbox instead applies a -10 penalty on checks to hear through the door.</p>
        <p>By making a DC20 craft (alchemy) check, a person can erase or record a message that is two minutes or shorter in length. When wound, the cricket will instead play the message, but the message cannot be heard from over 5 feet away. This still reduces eavesdropping but has no effect on doors.</p>

        <img src="images/styx-oil.png" alt="Styx Oil">
        <p>Styx oil is a carefully distilled combination of antitoxin, bloodroot, id moss, and various mushrooms. Styx oil renders its target unconscious and floods every sense with erratic hallucinations, overwhelming the mind and essentially wiping away memories.</p>
        <p>This chaotic mélange wipes away memories of the 5 minutes prior to the poison’s injection; occasionally, though, the drug fails to paralyze its victim, leaving the creature to flail violently and unpredictably in response to the hallucinations. If Styx oil is delivered by a weapon rather than injection or other subtle method, the victim gains a +5 circumstance bonus to resist the memory-erasing properties of the poison. </p>
        <p>Type: poison, injury; Save: Fortitude DC16; Frequency: 1/minute for 2 minutes; Initial Effect: unconscious for 1d4 minutes; Secondary Effect: confusion for 2d6 rounds; Cure: 2 saves</p>
