      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Soldier's Glory</b>
        <li style="display: none;">
          <p>This remarkable sword was the companion of Honaria Alcasti, famous general and defender of Taldor ahead of and into the even-tongued rebellion. While in such a position of Honor, the Alcasti family bred Pegasi, and Honaria famously rode her Pegasus companion, Glory, at the head of the company when performing maneuvers or charging into battle. While chasing down a band of Andoran defectors ahead of the country secession, the defectors laid a trap for the General. Using magic, they forced Glory to the ground, throwing Honaria from her who lost her sword in the fall. The defector's leader stabbed Glory in the heart, killing him, and demanded Honaria’s surrender. Instead, she pulled the sword from her steed, which seemed imbued with the Pegasus’ magic, and slew them where they stood. She carried the sword with her to her dying day, which reportedly bore both the magic and intelligence of her slain Pegasus, though the magic seemed to fade with Honaria’s death and posthumous dishonor. With the family barony taken from them, Glory was the last, and proudest, Alcasti Pegasus rode into battle, and the sword, dubbed Soldiers Glory, is the legacy of that line.</p>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>The Natural Lab of Dumos Fatomax</b>
        <li style="display: none;">
          <p>Eye – Inner part of the blossom, utilized in abjuration magic, with freshly picked specimens recommended for banishment spells for their increased potency.</p>
          <p>Paw, Foot, Leg, Wing, and Toe – Leaf, names chosen depending on the shape, utilized in conjuration magic. Paws and Wings are used for summoning animals and outsiders respectively. Legs are used for creation magic, while feet are used for teleportation magic, and toes are used for all other spells.</p>
          <p>Guts – Roots and stalk, used in divination magic. Plant harvested must die for the divination spell to be considered effective.</p>
          <p>Hair – Dried version of herb, used in enchantments. Must be devoid of moisture or the effects of the spell will seep out of the intended target.</p>
          <p>Tail – Stem, used in evocation magic. It is not necessary to burn the stem for pyromancy.</p>
          <p>Head – Whole flower blossom, used in illusion magic. The quality of the illusion seems to be directly corollary to the quality of the blossom, and drooping petals will often result in drooping and disbelieve illusions.</p>
          <p>Tongue – Flower petal, used in necromancy magic. Life is bled from the petals during use, and the petals color vibrancy seems directly proportional to the amount of energy available.</p>
          <p>Heart – Plant seed, used in transmutation magic. Working theory – spell power increases based upon the seeds growth potential, difficult to prove.</p>
          <p>Bed – Soil from an uprooted plant, used in universalist magic.</p>
          <p> - "Parts of a Plant" notation found within the lab.</p>

      <h2>Gishvit Experimental Extract - Memory Extraction</h2>
      <h3>Some success at transcribing memories has been seen by utilizing extract distilled from Gishvit venom. The imbiber must be willing for the effect to work, the imbiber is asked a question, and then the nearest stack of paper is transcribed with the most powerful memory associated with the question. So far, it seems that extra pages are ruined, but if not enough pages are provided, the memory gets cut off early. It also seems that, so far, each person may only have memories extracted once.
      <br>Caution - Do no use when the nearest pile of pages is a book with potentially important content.</h3>
