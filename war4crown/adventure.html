      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Soldier's Glory</b>
        <li style="display: none;">This remarkable sword was the companion of Honaria Alcasti, famous general and defender of Taldor ahead of and into the even-tongued rebellion. While in such a position of Honor, the Alcasti family bred Pegasi, and Honaria famously rode her Pegasus companion, Glory, at the head of the company when performing maneuvers or charging into battle. While chasing down a band of Andoran defectors ahead of the country secession, the defectors laid a trap for the General. Using magic, they forced Glory to the ground, throwing Honaria from her who lost her sword in the fall. The defector's leader stabbed Glory in the heart, killing him, and demanded Honaria’s surrender. Instead, she pulled the sword from her steed, which seemed imbued with the Pegasus’ magic, and slew them where they stood. She carried the sword with her to her dying day, which reportedly bore both the magic and intelligence of her slain Pegasus, though the magic seemed to fade with Honaria’s death and posthumous dishonor. With the family barony taken from them, Glory was the last, and proudest, Alcasti Pegasus rode into battle, and the sword, dubbed Soldiers Glory, is the legacy of that line.</li>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Dignities Barb</b>
        <li style="display: none;">Our heroes, tall and proud, riding against the frozen wind, bear aloft the standard high of Taldors noble Army. The fourth time calling to the wild, these soldiers bring civility in their wake to forsaken lands of Kellid Lords with riches squandered on frosted ambition.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Clear-eyed Gerefein, general of this storied past, looked out against the driving snow to see what his troops could not. A horde of fur and foaming mouths, the barbarians lay in wait, like rocks at the foot of a mountain, countless and innumerable.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">In the snow, these frozen men, with spears and clubs in hand, crawled silently toward the horsemen, letting the frost blanket them out of sight. Unfeeling, uncaring, these mindless beasts lay in wait without honor to slay our heroes, tall and proud, in frozen lands far from their home.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">With a blink, Gerefein could see no longer the danger that lay in store. He doubted, he wondered, he questioned his eyes, but he could not risk his troops needlessly. He called for a sudden charge, counting on surprise to catch the cowards unawares, and with his spurs, he surged forward, into the driving blizzard.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Surging forward, Gerefein led his startled troops into a charge, and with sword and lance and spear and ax, they stormed over the cowards in the snow. With thunderous hooves as though applause, the horses surged towards their prey, our heroes swinging at the bulges in the snow, killing ambushers where they lay.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Then as though the wind had changed, the earth beneath them shook in reply, as near a thousand barbarians sprang with murder in their eyes. They grabbed our heroes, tall and proud, and threw them from their noble steeds, and with the cavalry so far ahead, the horde now lay between Gerefein and his army.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Cast to the snow with chill ever creeping, clear-eyed Gerefein saw and swore, as his army plodded unawares towards the waiting horde. Their horses pulled to the snow, the horsemen, tall and proud, fought alongside their steeds as best they could, while their blood thawed the frozen ground.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">In such a storm, Gerefein knew, that chaos would soon reign, and end the civility spread by explorations hardy gain. He took up his cross and bore his bow straight, brass and brown with lions roaring, and aimed ahead through the storm at the barbarian leading, charging, screaming.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">With only glimpses and frost creeping, Gerefein knew hope was fleeting, his men would die and despite their bleeding, they’d all be buried beneath the snow. He tried to see but could only guess at where their leader may be charging and looking down the length of his cross knew one shot was all he’d be having.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">And with a breath, clear-eyed Gerefein, champion of Taldor, and better trained than any barbarian, took his shot and watched with wonder as the bolt spun through the air. Twinning, spinning, ever veering, the bolt was carried by the wind, and through his expert aim, lodged in the heart of the leader of the horde.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">With shock and horror upon his face, their leader fell from his steed into the snow, and with his death so fell the remaining courage of the horde. They fled before the spear and sword, with Taldor’s Banner flying high, and in flight, they led our heroes, tall and proud, to the treasures hidden in their homes.</li>

      <h2>Recovered Journals</h2>
      <h3>Notable excerpts from journals found or recovered from various missions.</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Journal of Dagio the Great</b>
        <li style="display: none;">I no longer know what year it is, what decade it is, and having discovered that I will not die from the ravages of time, I believe it is time I set to pen and paper a record of my life, that future generations will be able to read of my legacy and know the great and powerful legacy of their god. I was once a simple rat and a magical companion to my master, a young wizard named Eros Glendower. He became enamored with circles, with its immaculate perfection, and the promise it constantly whispered of immortality. He realized that death is a price for common folk and that true nobility were beyond such things…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… It is time I write of my birth, or rather, my true birth. My birth into grand nobility, above that of the gods and peasantry subject to death. My master took us deep below the senate to rooms long since hidden to time. He drew a circle of diamond dust and began casting his spell. He was not worthy, however, he cast the spell wrong, and as the arcane magic filled his mortal flesh, he attempted to save himself by casting the magic into me. The fool! The spell consumed him, and in its wake, I was born, immortal and eternal, and I will reign here in the true senate of Taldor forever. From here, I control the most powerful empire in the world…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… I found his ashes again today. I had nearly forgotten what he smelled like, but the reminder of burning hair and roasting mage filled me with pity. I took what was left of his ashes and drew a perfect circle, spending hours making sure my calculations were exactly right. Here, on this table, his memorial will stand eternal, as the circle is eternal. The circle, which brought me immortality, will bring my power ever further…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… I stole my wand of power form the immortal guarding the library. My followers and I have settled in the Senate, where I sit as judge and god. From here, we weave the power of fate itself, drawing circles throughout the senate thus turning the wheels of destiny wheresoever we will. I send them to the ground above to bring back food and riches from our kingdom, and spread the circle wider still…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… Lives are fleeting unless they’re round. I carved one weak peasant today with a circle and his life was spent, but with his body, I had the ink to draw more. The circles leaked down the walls, loosing their initial perfection, but showing exactly how the radius and circumference of the circle changed the power of gravity on the bloody ink. This showed me how wrong I was, my math only scratched the surface on the perfection of the circle before, but I will start again to define the origin of god itself. 3.14159…</li>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Journal of Martella Lotheed - Sinora Academy</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>4698 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Gul dropped me off last week, and I’ve been instructed to record my thoughts in a journal. Everything I own was packed neatly into five trunks as I was driven to the Sinora Academy. Dad saw me off and hugged me tightly. I told him I loved him, and he whispered he loved me too, though not loud enough for mum to hear. If I can manage to learn magic, I can come home, but until then, I’m going to need to stay here. It’s nice here at least. Madame got me a cup of tea and visited with me while the servants unpacked my stuff into my room. I hate having to share my room with others though, there’s four of us here, two in each bedroom with an attached sitting room. I’ve heard that the older children have single-occupant rooms, though they still share an attached sitting room between each pair. I can’t wait to grow up.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4699 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I didn’t get to go home for holidays this year either. It’s lonely being here without anyone else. The others have come to realize that I don’t have the pocket money they have, and it’s been rather isolating. Dad still sends me an allowance, but it’s nothing like what the other girls have. We got along well when I first got here, but now we don’t play as much. They say they’ve grown up too much to play with dolls anymore, and none of them can stand bugs. I caught a frog the other day and Patricia screamed so loud I dropped him and he started hopping around, causing a panic. She said she’s not my friend anymore and that I can’t be around her or the other girls again. I didn’t mean anything by it…</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4700 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I spent the new year alone. I have too much homework to work on anyway to spend time at the parties. No one’s there to miss me, and I don’t have the money to spend on that. Instead, I’ve been working on refining my combustion turbine. I wanted to see if I could launch this into the sky alongside the pyrotechnics, but it isn’t ready.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4701 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I’m the top of my class, and everyone knows it. Patricia said it makes sense that I’m a bookworm since I have gross inky hair. I like my hair and my books. Madame says they’re just envious because I’m smart, but that doesn’t make me feel better. I still can’t do any magic and I know more than half the girls in school, but I can build things. Mister Geonorg says I’m the brightest pupil he’s had since he started teaching here, but he recommends I learn to fit in with the other girls. He said, “You don’t have to like the things they like, just learn to look the part. Then they’ll accept you and you can use their dim minds and stuffed pocketbooks to do whatever you want.” I like his advice better.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4702 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I was finally getting along with the other girls, well enough at least, before they moved me. Patricia said I was picking on her and turning her friends against her and complained to Madame. Madame decided to move me up two years, saying that I already understand these things well enough. Now I’m behind in all my classes, I don’t know anyone, and no one wants to get to know the “new girl two years too small.” Why did they have to put me here?</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4703 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I’ve been tutoring Eutropia for almost four months now, and I think she’s the first person here I can call a friend. I also met Gloriana, her childhood best friend, and we’ve been hitting it off. Eutropia has enough to pay for me when my allowance doesn’t cover, and Gloriana has been teaching us both how to dance. I don’t know what they see in me, and I have a feeling Gloriana doesn’t trust me just yet, but she does like m enough that we can all spend the days together.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4704 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Eutropia beat Calhadion in a duel today! Spanked his ass more like; he got tangled up and she tossed him into a pond. He was swearing at her so much he was escorted off the grounds; it was delicious! Eutropia has me convinced that whenever anyone asks me out, to always so “No” the first time – that’s the true test of their manhood. Most give up, several throws a fit, and none of them are worth my time. Maybe if ones cute and persistent, but as it is, none of them are worth our time. Calhadion was swearing about how we’re worse than his cousin, which just makes me want to send her a letter and find out if there’s a Vernisant out there with half a brain.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4705 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Daddy passed last month. I went to the funeral, probably only my fourth- or fifth-time home in almost seven years. It feels like a lifetime ago when I was happy there, with the sun on my face. Cateline was nice enough to let me sit next to her, though I was still at the end of the family row. I got back yesterday, only to have a meeting with Bartleby before I could go back to my room. I thanked him for letting me attend the funeral, but he waved off my words, admitting I was family, though it seemed to pain him to do so. Then what he said to me was such I shock I’ve been repeating it over and over in my head since he left.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“As you know, I have been bequeathed the estate and father’s responsibilities over the county after his heart-attack. As the new steward, there is much that I must get done, but there is one matter I would like to address first… Your attendance at father’s funeral at the Palace of Birdsong was the last time that you will step foot on Lotheed soil. Your presence in our household did nothing but aggravate my dear mother and drove her to an early death. After all that has happened, I am sick of the embarrassment you bring to our family name. You are dead to me, to the entire family, unless in the future you return to the palace with a suitor who would bring value to the Lotheed family; I highly doubt that will happen. I will also no longer allow the estate to squander any resources on you, including your outrageously high allowance. You may finish your schooling since father already paid for it but know that there is nothing else left for you.” </i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">He turned on his heels and wouldn’t look at me as he walked away. I went to my room crying and told Eutropia everything. She arranged to have Glorianna move into the adjoining room and replace Karina, and she tried to reassure me that it didn’t matter, that home was at the academy now, and that the three of us were as good as family and the only family we needed.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4706 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">We graduated from Sinora today. Glorianna headed to Absalom for a study-abroad term while I went with Eutropia back to Oppara. She’s going to be the first Grand Princess of Taldor, and I’m going to help her make it happen, but first, she needs to meet with her father.</li>

      <h2>Gishvit Experimental Extract - Memory Extraction</h2>
      <h3>Some success at transcribing memories has been seen by utilizing extract distilled from Gishvit venom. The imbiber must be willing for the effect to work, the imbiber is asked a question, and then the nearest stack of paper is transcribed with the most powerful memory associated with the question.

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b><i>Experiment 1</i> Lady Martella Lotheed - </b>Prompt: "Let's see if this works; what is my strongest memory?"
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/martella-little.jpg" alt="Young Martella Crying in the Garden"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><b>4698 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“I don’t understand, Martella; we’ve been over this before. I know you have a good grasp on magical theory; you know exactly what the components are; you should be further along then this… you’ve been practicing haven’t you?” </i> After a pregnant pause, the women's voice continues, <i>“Let’s try casting something simple today. How about Dancing Lights?” </i> the voice asks brightly.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Out of small eyes, we see tiny, chubby hands continuing to doodle sadly on a piece of paper on a sturdy desk. <i>“Please?”</i> the voice implores, prompting the little hands to stop as the view pans up to see what looks to be a small classroom. There are a few other desks around, a blackboard, and small stack of tomes solely focused on basics of arcane spell theory, and a bookish governess looking at you expectantly. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“I can try,”</i> Martella mutters down to her doodles. <i>“Speak up dear, it’s not lady-like to mumble. Come now. Stand up. Proper posture. Shoulders back. Now, cast the spell; you know exactly how it’s done.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Letting out a sigh before taking a breath, Little Martella stands up straight and starts drawing arcane symbols in the air while muttering the incantation. The governess nods along, cringing at the various mistakes with Martella’s hand motions and bumbling arcane pronunciation. Even with the small mistakes, dancing lights should still appear, maybe not as brightly or for as long as they should, but the little girl is startled and dismayed as only a small shower of sparks shoots from her hands and immediately fizzles out. The governess shakes her head and sighs deeply. <i>“Alright Martella, that’s enough for today. Run along and play with your brothers and sister.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Turning without a word, the view heads out the door of the classroom and starts wandering down the halls of her palatial home, keeping eyes mostly on the floor and the palace’s tiling, before stopping at a drawing-room to check the mirror and smooth out her blue jumper. Little Martella has big brown eyes, accentuated by her chubby childish form, with her thick hair expertly pulled back into a nice bun. Shoulders slumped, Martella focuses on her face, where we can see she’s holding back tears and struggles herself back into a semblance of composure. </li>
        <li style="display: none;">Hearing footsteps behind us, we peek around the corner to see the feet of the governess as she steps into the hall and joins up with a couple in the background. We hear the barely audible sounds of distant conversation, and Martella takes a deep breath and holds it, listening intently, trying to make out the words. The governess’ voice faintly comes across, <i>“…I’m sorry my Lord, but I just don’t think she has any sort of magical aptitude…” </i>The governess’ quiet is cut off by a women’s voice, snarling a little too loudly, <i>“She’s a blight on this family. Your blight!” </i>followed by footsteps storming off. <i>“Why can’t she be like Bartelby? Why can’t she manage to do anything?!” </i>the voice echoes off the walls, drowning out the others before Martella breathes out heavily and shakily, her sniffles drowning out any chance to hear more as tears well up in her eyes. </li>
        <li style="display: none;">Wiping tears away, Martella dashes down the hall and out into the sunshine in the gardens, running to the edge of a patio before plopping down and staring at the manicured trees and grass nearby. A brightly colored sparrow trills as it flies to a nearby tree, hopping back and forth while looking in our direction. Martella sniffles, and then pulls a handful of breadcrumbs, saved from this morning’s breakfast, out of her pocket. <i>“Here, I brought you something,” </i>she says as she holds out her hand. Carefully staying perfectly still, the sparrow flutters down to perch on her finger. She stifles a giggle as the little talons tickle her palm, and it quickly starts to peck apart the crumbs the little girl brought it.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Sitting, enjoying a moment of calm, we watch the bird and its fluid motions, smelling the scent of flowers on the air and enjoying the feeling of sunshine. The view darkens suddenly when a ball of mud hits Martella squarely on the cheek with an accompanying splat, causing the view to stumble as the sparrow chatters angrily and flies off. You hear the laughter of a group of boys in the background, five of various ages. The eldest, already a handsome brown-haired boy heading into puberty, is the culprit of the mudslinging, while the others carry wooden swords they’d been using while playing in another field.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“Oh, Lady Bastard, what are you doing playing in the dirt?” </i>the eldest boy calls out, causing the others to laugh maliciously. He scoops up another handful of mud and approaches while forming it into a ball, <i>“I heard father tell Gul to start packing up your things and order you a carriage to the Sinora Academy… Do you want to know why?” </i>He winds up his arm and chucks the mud, and Martella tries not to flinch as the mud splatters her back as it breaks against her shoulder. Tears start to well up in her eyes again and Martella looks away at the grass in front of her before being spun around, so she has no choice but to look at the eldest boy. He grabs her chin and twists her head to the side, <i>“It’s because you’re a stain on this family. Mum said so. And, oh, look here, I found the stain,” </i>he says harshly in her ear as he grinds his muddy thumb into her cheek.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">He lets Martella go, who stands up and turns to run, only to be shoved so that she lands butt-first in the garden dirt. <i>"Oh no, you stained your pants, Martella." </i>The other boys laugh as he looms over her, <i>“Mum won’t be pleased, but I bet the servants are used to washing out the stains you leave in your clothes. You want to know why? Because you’re dirty. You’re filth. Everyone says so. You can dress up all you like, but everyone can see it. It’s plain as day.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Sobbing, Martella lashes out with her foot, kicking her brother in the knee before scrambling off. <i>“How dare you touch me, desert-dweller!” </i>The boys chase her down, pelting balls of mud at the fleeing child before a particularly dense clump knocks her to the ground and the boys pin her where she fell. The eldest snarls and his shadow crosses over Martella’s face, <i>“I’m going to put this stain back in the ground where it belongs,” </i>he shouts as he starts pilling mud and dirt on top of her while the boys hold her in place, one of them pinning her head to the side while he spits in her ear.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">As Martella slowly gets covered, with the odd or twist from the bullying, she looks out at the pretty garden whose serenity is now shattered. We see through Martella’s eyes that she mentally removes herself from the situation by focusing on tuft grass short ways off. As her view gets covered by one handful of dirt after another, we see a cricket sitting on an extremely long blade of grass in the tuft, and we focus in on it, tuning everything else out. It nibbles on the blade and rubs its hind legs together making its distinctive chirping noise. The longer we stare at the cricket, the louder and louder its chirping becomes, until the devilish laughter of the boys is nearly drowned out and forgotten…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">-	Martella’s strongest memory kept partly as proof of her successful experiment and kept partly as a reminder.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b><i>Experiment 2</i> Grand Prince Stavian III -</b> Prompt: "How did you become Grand Prince of Taldor?" 
        <li style="display: none;"><b>4664 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">We hear the harsh whistle of a cold wind rushing by while looking out upon the grey-white scene of a particularly harsh winter that has blown in off the Inner Sea, blanketing the opulent buildings of Oppara in a thin layer of ice. After watching the scene for a while, it becomes clear that we are staring out a window, through the eyes of a young boy whose face we can see hazily reflected in the glass. He’s about 11 years of age and sitting on a wide sill, his knees tucked up against his chest as he stares forlornly out the window. His shoulder-length brown hair looks like it hasn’t seen a brush for days, while his clothes look like they could use a press. He sniffles and wipes his nose with the back of his sleeve, whether from sickness or sadness its uncertain, but his naturally intense gaze remains fixed on the icy gravel path outside.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Suddenly, a figure bundled against the cold hustles out from behind the topiary and past the guards through one of the main servants’ doors. We hear the distant thud of a solid oak door somewhere in the building, and the boy quickly scrambles from his position. He scurries out of the study and into a hallway dressed finely in tapestries and thick carpeting. From the far side of the hallway, we hear doors slamming, raised voices, and boots steadily thudding their way upstairs and towards the boy. Quickly ducking into the doorway of an open room, we hide behind the doorframe and listen.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“Presenting Grand Prince Stavian II, Doge of…” </i>A booming voice is suddenly cut off along with an accompanying ‘oof’. Peeking out, we see a herald sprawled on the ground in the wake of a handsome man dressed in well-made robes with the same shoulder-length brown hair and intense gaze as the boy. The man looks like he hasn’t slept in days, and the rage in his eyes reflects that. The herald scurries out of the room while the man berates a different, thin man of obviously Keleshite heritage, dressed in clerical robes.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“You Sarenites are all the same! Liars and cheats! All out to get what you can! Push your own agendas! I lifted the ban on your faith and gave my word not to reinstate it. I’ve supplied all the materials and offered piled of coin and property. For what more would you hold my son's life ransom?”</i>The handsome man spats in anger.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The cleric winces, but his eyes show only empathy for the man in front of him, <i>“Sire, please,” </i>he clasps his hands together in a motion of prayer and forgiveness, <i>“I know you are experiencing tremendous pain right now, but you must listen… I, along with all the other priests you have summoned before me, cannot bring your son back. It is not for a lack of trying or power, but as others have said, it is simply because your son’s soul has already been judged. The Lady of Graves had little to weigh with such a young and pure soul taken so early by sickness. He has been sent on to Nirvana where he can rest, and from where his soul refuses to move. I am sorry, but we have done all that we can. No one else will be able to bring back Prince Carrius. The people of Taldor are just as distraught by his loss, and we mourn with you.”</i> The cleric bows and slowly back-steps away from the Grand Prince and between two hulking Ulfen Guard to make his escape from the grieving monarch.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Looking away, the boy slumps to the ground, crestfallen, and he wipes his nose and face again. Then, he stiffens as he hears shouts of anger, crashes, splintering wood, and crumbling plaster. After waiting for the space of several breaths, he looks out again to see broken chairs strewn about the floor and a table tossed clumsily into a nearby wall. A blur of legs passes the open door and a newcomer approaches the Grand Prince from behind. <i>"Your Majesty?"</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The Grand Prince turns around at his servant's voice, <i>“Calpurnus, dispatch more messengers across all of Avistan! Send them all throughout Garund and Casmoran if you must! Someone out there has the power to bring him back even if the Sarenites can’t!” </i>The man is red in the face screaming at what must be his steward.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“Sire, I have run across Oppara myself and knocked on every temple within the city. None of the priests say they have the power to bring him back. They say the time to do so has passed, especially if his soul wishes to stay in Nirvana. There is nothing more to do. It is time to mourn the prince and allow the country to mourn as well.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The prince pauses, breathing heavily as his chest and shoulders heave up and down, <i>“Fine. But I want no expense spared on his funeral. I will not have him put to rest without a proper ceremony. He deserves the luxuries befitting an heir of the crown.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“Sire, you still have an heir.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“The lesser one, you mean? Boy didn’t even have the balls to attend his mother’s funeral. Hasn’t even got the courage to show his face around here for the past four days. Doesn’t have the stones, spine, or brains of his brother, nor enough of them to push aside his ‘sensitivities’ to deal with reality! What a Grand Prince he’ll make, eh?”</i> he laughs maniacally. <i>“A Grand Prince cannot run and hide whenever reality gets tough. That’s when decisions need to be made and true rulers shine.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The boy looks at his shoes, forcing the world around to the background as he listens but doesn’t watch any longer. He tucks his knees closer to his chest and buries his face, hiding the world in darkness. There’s a little more grumbling back and forth in the hallway before we hear the sound of footsteps moving away to somewhere else in the castle, <i>“Sire, might I suggest raising the taxes on the lower classes again to help pay for some of these expenditures? They are quite sympathetic to the loss of the young prince…”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The boy lets out a shaky breath. His hand is trembling, and he slowly pulls himself to his feet. He wanders back to the windowsill and looks out at the peaceful city beneath. He stares at his reflection, a variety of emotions play across his face as he bites his trembling lip: anger, anguish, and complete and utter devastation. <i>"Lesser," </i>he breathes out, his eyes betray him first and a tear escapes, followed shortly by a second, and then a whole flood. He gently curls into a ball on the floor and sobs as quietly as possible, holding his knees to his chest. Alone in a cold, dark, empty room devoid of any sort of comfort, the howling of the winter storm outside becomes louder as the scene slowly fades to black.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"> - Extracted and quickly hidden, with the excuse that the experiment did not work. It is unlikely that the Grand Prince would have allowed this record to continue to exist if he read its contents.</li>
        </ul><ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;">
      </ul>

      <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><b><i>Experiment 3</i> Lotheed Family Halfling Servant – </b>Prompt: “How did Martella come to the Palace of Birdsong?”
        <li style="display: none;"><b>4691 AR</b></li>
        <li style="display: none;">We hear birds chirping happily and the gentle hum of insects on a warm summer’s day. A light breeze gently rustles the leaves through the trees nearby while swans strut about the grounds looking for bird feed. The view fidgets sporadically as a carriage slowly approaches up the long drive. The driver calls out, <i>“Delivery for the lord of the house!” </i>After stepping forward slightly, the carriage driver finishes pulling up and spits on the halfling in front of him, <i>“Not for you, sneak-swipe, go get your master.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Brushing the spittle from their shirt, the image turns as the halfling dashes into the building and down the hallway to the back patio, stumbling slightly once or twice before reaching the rear door. Opening it slowly, we see a well-dressed man with greying light brown hair tied back at the nape of his neck, lounging on the patio of the immense palace. The man is wearing a pair of spectacles and is completely absorbed in a messy pile of accounting reports in front of him. He leans forward on his darkwood chair and brings a hand up to rub his chin thoughtfully as he considers the reports before him.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“My Lord? Excuse me, my Lord?” </i>After no response, the halfing hesitantly approaches his master and a small hand tentatively touches the man’s shoulder, causing him to jump a little in his chair. <i>“What!?” </i>he shours angrily, <i>"Can't you see I'm busy?!"</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The Halfling ducks his head apologetically, <i>“I-I’m sorry sir, but there’s a m-messenger w-with a delivery, a-at the servant’s door.” “Well? Why didn’t you accept it then?” “Er… I w-was told that the delivery is only for y-you, m-my Lord.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The man chucks down his papers, glowering at the servant, then grumbles to himself as he trudges around the side of the gorgeous summer palace to the main servants’ door. The Halfling timidly follows behind, being extremely careful to leave a few good paces between him and his lord.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Coming around a wall, the noble spots a young man, maybe in his late teens, waiting on the stone steps up to the servants’ door. The noble’s brow furrows; the teenager has darkened skin tones and is wearing a white tunic and turban in a Qadiran style. A large basket rests at his feet and a Qadiran bred horse grazes nearby. The noble haughtily puffs out his chest and strolls up to the boy, being sure to tower over him even as he stands on the steps.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>“I don’t buy stolen Taldan goods from Qadiran bandits. Leave my home at once, or I’ll have you arrested and flogged up and down my city.”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The boy, to his credit, feigns being taken aback for a moment before a cheeky smile crosses his lips. <i>“My Lord, the goods I carry weren’t stolen; they are rightfully yours. I’m delivering them.” </i>He bends down to scoop something out of the basket. <i>“Her Ladyship Ammala Qusan gave me specific instructions to inform you that she regrets ever being charmed into bed with the ‘smallest dagger in all of Golarion’, and she deeply appreciated it when you did not offer her any social protections, under the circumstances.” </i>The boy grunts as he drops a swaddled newborn, perhaps two days old, into the arms of the stunned noble.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The man is shocked as he pulls away some of the swaddling to reveal a perfectly round face with a shock of dark brown Qadiran hair. <i>“Ya Ibn el Sharmouta kafeer al-Lotheedar,” the messenger boy says before spitting at the noble’s feet. “How DARE you!” </i>The boy quickly runs to his horse, hops on, and gallops away from the palace, kicking up clods of dirt and trampling through the flower bed before the man can take more than three steps while carrying the infant.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The noble stands there and fumes silently, staring after the disappearing form of the boy in the turban. The baby starts to coo and the lines in the man’s face slowly fade as he looks down at the baby girl. The man then reluctantly gives the baby his index finger which grabs onto it tightly. The man tries to smile, but it can’t evolve past a smirk on his face. <i>“Well, with your mother’s blood you’ll be a beauty… With mine, you should have a measure of arcane skill… Either way, you should grow up quickly and we’ll find a suitor to sell you off to. Oh yes, we will; oh yes, we will. Lady Lotheed is not going to be thrilled when she sees you…”</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The man walks back around the side of the house and into the palace as the halfling wanders towards the flower bed to tend the damage, patting down disturbed clumps of earth and grass. Looking out, the grounds are picturesque, home to at least hundreds of species of different birds that flitter about the massive gardens. The pristine silence is broken by a woman’s shrill, angry expletive and the shattering of fine china, forcing all the birds in the area into panicked flight.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"> -	Extracted from a halfling house servant, witness to the delivery of Lady Martella Lotheed to the family home, the Palace of Birdsong.</li>
