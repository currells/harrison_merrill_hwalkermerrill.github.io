        <h2>How Used</h2>
        <p>Typography is similar to the alignment and proximity rules, but it is more complex and less clear cut, putting it firmly in the realm of art, where there are no set-rules, only guidelines. Typography is the principle of design that correlates to how the arrangement and composition of text can help organize information and make it more legible, readable, and appealing. Typography includes the use of fonts, sizes, spacing, indentation, etc. In the screenshot from Dropbox, it is easy to see how the different fonts and organization help to enrich the message. The logo combines both a dark and bold title “Dropbox” while also having a slim and colored title “Business” adjacent to it to both unify the message under the dropbox name while categorizing the information as targeting business owners. The slim font within the message is non-threatening and centered in a descending structure, drawing the eyes to the central button on the screen while also drawing attention to the purchase link beneath it. Typography is a skill that needs to be developed over time with practice, but it helps to bring things together visually, making the same information more appealing and professional looking while also making it easier to understand and providing emphasis to key points.</p>
