        <li style="display: none;">Notice to Trespassers<br> You may have noticed that you’re trapped, doomed to live out the remainder of your miserable lives here, seeking penance for your crimes. The only way out of here is to accompany me, Lord Vheed, as my mayoral badge of office unlocks the doors. I have left my spare key in here, just in case I have need of it, or in case one of you are worth more than the scabs and urchins of the street. The key is attached to a red flag, on an island, in a lake, at the far end of my vault. If you retrieve the key, then you are worthy to escape, and may take with you anything you find here. In the likely event that you are not, you may console yourself with the knowledge that your death will further the sciences, and your bodies and souls will be used for greater purpose than you could’ve achieved in life.<br> Best Regards, Lord Dargentu Vheed, Mayor of Westcrown</li>

        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/note-pathfinder-names.jpg" alt="MissingPathfinder List"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Mayor Vheed - </li>
        <li style="display: none;">Presented below is what I have been able to piece together regarding the Pathfinders who escaped notice after they sealed Delvehaven during the initial riots in the pre-Thrune unpleasantness. After the passage of seventy-some years, it would seem likely that only Sivanshin still lives, and if you wish, I can send my agents north to Nidal to attempt to find him. The use of grave tallow to interrogate those who have been dead these past several decades ironically makes them more available to interview than Sivanshin—provided we can find their remains, of course. I am happy to report that I’ve made some progress in that area.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">1. Donatalus Bisby: Leader of Amber Privateers and one of only two survivors of a journey to darkest Mwangi—he has firsthand knowledge of at least one magical artifact that could well serve our needs for control. It would seem Bisby was sealed inside one of Delvehaven’s lower vaults as the others fled, but I’m unclear if this was a voluntary sacrifice.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">2. Ilnerik Sivanshin: Bisby’s chronicler, a half-elf, Sivanshin fled Westcrown a week before Aroden’s Fall. Evidence suggests he fled north, toward Nidal, and with a stolen relic.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">3. Coriana Heavenscape: A Westcrown native and, if rumor is to be believed, an aasimar, Coriana remained in Westcrown and organized the Father’s Bulwark, one of many groups of rebels glorious Thrune smashed in the pursuit of establishing order. She was slain and her remains collected by the Sisters of Eiseth—I’ve got them sifting through their holdings in an attempt to find her.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">4. Loremaster Liriam: Delvehaven’s master of lore—no other would know more about the vaults below. Alas, no evidence of his survival has surfaced—like Bisby, his remains might still lie within Delvehaven. I do suspect he was the author of “Cugny’s Wedding,” and if so, your suspicion that it is a cipher may well be correct.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">5. Venture-Captain Aiger Ghaelfin: Aiger was certainly the one who ordered the sealing of Delvehaven. My early research indicated that he planned on fleeing Cheliax for Absalom, but further investigation revealed this to be false. He remained in Westcrown and fought alongside Coriana in the Father’s Bulwark, but was laid low by a Thrune wizard who petrified him and then smashed the resulting statue. Scuttlebutt among the blood bookie circuit is that the remains of the man’s petrified body have been in the possession of one of the lesser noble houses involved in bloodsport, but I’ve not yet determined which family (I suspect the Luccas). These filthy has-been nobles play well enough when faced with Thrunish agents, but without the direct aid of your allies, master, I’m afraid I won’t be able to learn more…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">- Note found within <i>Chelish Crux</i> alongside a series of Ledgers, five oddly shaped candles, and the Poetic Cipher, <i>Cugny's Wedding</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Cugny's Wedding</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/note-cugny's-wedding.jpg" alt="Cugny's Wedding"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;">This Poetic Cypher, written by Loremaster Liriam and titled <i>Cugny's Wedding</i> contains an odd meter, with too many syllables on the first of every three lines. Upon careful examination, that last syllable, assembled together, creates a second poem titled, <i>The Wave Door</i>, which seems to be directions to a cache of items - and potentially the keys to accessing the lower vaults of Delvehaven - hidden in an extradimensional pocket in Cutlass Cove. The poem reads as follows:</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><i>"The Wave Door lies within Cut Lass - From Wart three-hundred salt soaked feet Nor-east the pathfinder must pass. Grand Lodge light must show the way: Delvehaven's oath will cause the fray."</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br>Having been interpreted, <i>The Wave Door</i> poem reveals the following directions.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">1: The Wave Door is located in Cutlass Cove, above the waves of the cove itself and about 100 yards off the shore of the black sand beach on the northeast shore of the uninhabited island of Wart Rock.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">2: The Wave Door can only be opened at night.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">3: In order to open the Wave Door, someone must first activate a wayfinder to create light so that the light created falls upon the point in space above the water where the Wave Door is located.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">4: Once the location is lit, someone must recite Delvehaven’s Oath, a vow taken by all Pathfinders when they join Delvehaven’s roster, by making a Perform [oratory] check and 1 full minute of vocalizing.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Last Words of Liriam</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/note-liriam.jpg" alt="Note-Liriam"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>To Whomever Finds This -</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>It is, of course, my fervent hope that the reader of this missive is a friend of the Pathfinders. In the days before the madness and riots, before Cheliax tore itself apart, there were signs that the end was coming. Among those was Delvehaven’s desertion by one of her own. I now believe that Ilnerik stole half of the Aohl—the Totemrix—and judging by the growing power and magical potential of the Morrowfall, I fear that Ilnerik has unwittingly exposed himself to magic fell and vile. The power building in the Morrowfall is frightening, and we’ve secured it deep below Delvehaven in a vault called the Amber Arca. If my theory is correct and the Totemrix is a Vyriavaxian relic, then Ilnerik is being exposed to shadowy magic of a great evil. If he hasn’t become a vampire by this time, I fear he soon will. I’ve managed to secure a few tools here should that be the case, and hope to come back later to stash some more in the event of his return, but things grow increasingly dangerous in Westcrown, and I fear that none of us shall live to see the end of the year.</i></li>

        <h3>Ring of Shifting Alliances</h3>
        <img src="images/corianas-ring-aohl.jpg" alt="Coriana's Dualism Ring">
        <p>This unique <i>ring of protection +2</i> was worn by the famous missing amber privateer and pathfinder, Coriana. It is promised to protect the wearer and creatures within 10 feet from many of the keyed traps within Delvehaven's lower levels.</p>
        <p>In addition to its regular powers, the wearer of the ring is always treated as the most favorable alignment for the purposes of being affected by spells and effects, such as a paladin's smite or the extra damage from an unholy weapon or spell.</p>

        <h3>Dawnhunter</h3>
        <img src="images/dawnhunter.jpg" alt="Dawnhunter">
        <p>This red-and-gold <i>+1 light fortification breastplate</i> is crafted and painted to look as if it had been carved from stone. It belonged to Commander Helmrunner of the Ever-Advancing Legion, said to have been one of the dwarven commanders to lead an army to the surface during the Quest for the Sky so long ago.</p>
        <p>In areas of magical darkness, <i>Dawnhunter</i> radiates light with an effect spell level identicle to the spell creating magical darkness at a range of 5 ft. radius per spell level. This light counters and dispels magical darkness within its radius only. When worn by a dwarf, the dwarf gains damage reduction equal to the <i>Dawnhunter's</i> effective spell level that cannot be bypassed. Creatures with light sensitivity, light blindness, or a weakness to natural sunlight must roll twice and take the worse result against the <i>Dawnhunter's</i> fortification ability.</p>
        <p><i>Dawnhunter</i> can only be destroyed by a dwarf knowingly and willingly carrying it back to the depths where it was forged without the use of magic and living for 100 years in absolute darkness.</p>

        <h3>Morrowfall</h3>
        <img src="images/morrowfall.jpg" alt="Morrowfall">
        <p>The Morrowfall is one-half of the Aohl, an artifact gifted to the ancient Jaytirian Society following a sacred truce between their two feuding gods of millennia past. The Morrowfall is the remaining manifestation of the power of Easivra, a potent sun god now all but forgotten (it’s a DC 30 Knowledge [religion] check to recognize Easivra’s name or holy symbol).</p>
        <p>The Morrowfall constantly emits <i>daylight</i>, as per the spell, and counts as a holy symbol of Easivra. In addition, by presenting it strongly and uttering Easivra’s name (a standard action), the Morrowfall can be used to cast the following spells at Caster Level 15th:
          <br>At Will – Disrupt Undead; 1/day – Searing Light; 1/Week – Sunbeam (DC 20)</p>
        <p>Curse: The Morrowfall’s spells have no effect on a creature wielding the Totemrix. Once donned, the Morrowfall imparts a compulsion to join it with its counterpart, the Totemrix,  and the owner becomes possessive of the artifact and will not voluntarily relinquish it preventing and it may not be removed except by first casting a remove-curse spell, though the compulsion and obsession remains. Each time the owner commits an evil act, they gain one negative level which cannot be overcome in any way while the Morrowfall is worn and returns immediately if the Morrowfall is donned again. They also gain 2 negative levels for each step their alignment is away from Lawful Good. If they are destroyed by these negative levels, they are purified of their sins, causing them to rise as an undead powered by positive energy and an Avatar of Easivra.</p>
        <p>Avatar of Easivra Bonus: For 1 minute/ day, the player may sprout eagle wings made of pure light as a standard action, granting a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability as the spell <i>fly</i>. Characters of faithful classes gain additional bonuses.
          <br>Clerics and inquisitors gain an extra domain from Easivra’s list. Oracles gain the Solar mystery as an additional mystery or a mystery of their choice if they already have the solar mystery, though their revelation progression remains unchanged; oracles only gain one final revelation and must choose between their available options. Warpriests gain weapon focus (Morningstar) as a bonus feat and may choose one additional blessing from Easivra’s list. Paladins gain extra lay on hands as a bonus feat; At first level, any weapon the paladin is proficient with (including unarmed strikes if they have improved unarmed strike) is treated as though it were masterwork and are treated as though under the effect of additional spells at the following levels: <i>bless weapon at 4th</i>, <i>weapon of awe</i> at 8th, <i>greater magic weapon</i> at 12th, and <i>crusader’s edge</i> at 16th; these effects are cumulative and operated as if cast by a caster with a caster level equal to the paladin’s caster level except with a permanent duration, and if dispelled they are renewed when the paladin regains their spells or after 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Aohl</h3>
        <img src="images/morrowfall.jpg" alt="Aohl">
        <p>This fully recombined artifact has a golden eagle on one side and a bat on the other, bound together in an ancient pact between the two dieties, Easivra and Viriavaxus in a now-forgotten dualistic religion. The Aohl cannot be destroyed, but may be split apart into three corallating pieces only by two people with equal claim upon the artifact who found it as friends and seperate as enemies.</p>
        <p>The Aohl appears to be a non-magical but high-quality holy symbol to unknown gods (Easivra and Viriavaxus), but is in fact shrouded by a permanent <i>magic aura</i>. A wearer may cause it to start or stop radiating <i>daylight</i> or <i>deaper darkness</i> as a swift action by calling upon Easivra or Viriavaxus respectively. A worshipper of either diety may also call upon either of them as a standard action to cast any of the following spells (CL15) from the spell pool, with spells with the light descriptor resulting from calling upon Easivra and spells with the darkness descriptor resulting from calling upon Viriavaxus:
          <br>At Will - Detect Undead, Disrupt Undead/ Disrupt Living, Daze Monster (DC13); 7/day Blindness/ Deafness (DC13); 3/day searing light/ searing darkness; 1/day sunbeam/ enervation (DC20)</p>
        <p>Avatar of Easivra: An Avatar of Easivra does not need to call upon Viriavaxus to use his variant of abilities, though they do sense only mild dissaproval from Easivra if they choose to do so anyway. Easivra no longer automatically manifests to choose an avatar, but worshippers of Easivra may call upon her while holding the Aohl to try to become her Avatar. While wearing the Aohl, the Avatar of Easivra may sprout their golden wings at will as a standard action and dismiss their wings as a free action, though it retains its one-minute time limit. Once per day, by presenting the Aohl as a standard action, an Avatar of Easivra may cast Sunburst (DC22). However, after casting Sunburst the Avatar of Easivra may no longer sprout wings until the following sunrise.</p>

    <h2>Unique Magical Items</h2>
    <div class="agent">
      <article>
        <h3>Chelish Crux</h3>
        <img src="images/chelish-crux.jpg" alt="Chelish Crux">
        <p>This strange and baffling object appears to be a silver dodecahedron made of silver platted cold iron and measures about 5lbs and 6" in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune, and when one looks upon the thing, the observer has the unsettling sensation that they can see either too many or too few sides at once. Rolling the <i>Crux</i> makes it abundantly clear that the object is hollow, with numerous objects within sliding around.</p>
        <p>A <i>Chelix Crux</i> is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest, and functions the same way as a bag of holding when determining how long a living creature can survive within or what happens when placed inside another extradimensional object, with the exception that its contents do not errupt when placed within an <i>anti-magic field</i>, it instead becoming temporarily impossible to open.</p>
        <p>Once a particular <i>Chelish Crux's</i> combination is known, a character can open it automatically as a three-round action, though it cannot be opened by a creature with a weakness to cold-iron, silver, or evil-aligned weapons. Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal, with the objects inside appearing in the center of the sheet. An unfolded <i>Crux</i> automattically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheets four corners as a move-equivallent action, folding up around any objects that sit upon its face at the time. The sight of the <i>Crux</i> folding around an item appears as though the items are being crushed and snapped at odd angles, though when it is opened, the items inside are revealed to be unharmed.</p>
        <p>A <i>Chelish Crux</i> can hold up to 200 lbs of objects, but the physical size of the contents is irrelevant. Objects that would exceed the <i>Crux's</i> capacity are instead gently pushed aside by the refolding action. A <i>Chelish Crux</i> has a hardness of 10 and 300 hit points which regenerate at a rate of 12 per round, and can be forced open with a strength check of 28. If forced open, the <i>Crux</i> is destroyed, dealing 12d6 + 24 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects within a 10-foot-radius, including to its contents (reflex DC 25 halves). This fire damage bypasses any immunities and resistances held by creatures who have damage reduction bypassed by silver, cold iron, or evil-aligned weapons and deals double damage to creatures of the extraplanar subtype.</p>

        <h3>Grave Tallow</h3>
        <img src="images/grave-candle.jpg" alt="Grave Tallow">
        <!--<p>The properties of these strange candles are not yet known, though they emit no magical aura and are referenced as being a means to interrogate the dead.</p>-->
        <p>These magical candles draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing for a short seance with the deceased while the candle's wick burns.</p>
        <p>In order to function, a <i>grave tallow</i> must be placed amid the physical remains of the body to be spoken with. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a tottally destroyed body (such as the results of a <i>destruction</i> or <i>disintegrate</i>) doesn't leave enough material for a <i>grave tallow</i> to function. When list, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance manifests in the smoke.</p>
        <p>At this point, the manifested spirit can speak, adhearing to the rules for a <i>speak with dead</i>, except the condition of the remains does not affect the spirits ability to communicate, and the spirit always manifests - though it is still limited to what it knew during life and answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive if the creature would have opposed the summoner in life. After five questions have been asked, the candle burns away and the smoke dissipates. Further more, once a body has been spoken with via a <i>grave tallow</i> it cannot be spoken with again via another candle, <i>speak with dead</i>, or similar ability including <i>wish</i> as the burning of the candle "burns out" the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's parting from the world (this does not harm their actual soul). Communication with the departed after the use of a <i>grave tallow</i> instead requires bringing the deceased back from the dead.</p>

        <h3>Truecolor Dye</h3>
        <img src="images/truecolor-dye.jpg" alt="Truecolor Dye">
        <p>Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the Miracle Samurai during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades. </p>
        <p>Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer—the viewer’s good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye’s nature.</p>
        <p>A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.</p>

        <h3>Vintage Potions</h3>
        <img src="images/vintage-potions.jpg" alt="Vintage Potions">
        <p>A legendary retired Pathfinder-turned-brewer named Zoan “Vintage” Tyspar, whose own life was saved repeatedly by potions during his adventuring career, asked why it was necessary for the standard magical elixir to taste so incredibly awful. Tackling the problem with enthusiasm, he experimented with the means to safely mix his creations with a selection of fine wines and spirits. In time, Vintage even began bottling his successes in glass wine bottles, much to the delight of the other Pathfinders. Those that followed the works of Vintage came to know which brands and years symbolized the different magical effects available. Those who did not were on the receiving end of good-natured jokes.</p>
        <p>Each full bottle of vintage potions contain a total of six doses. While these may be taken normally, when forcing a bottle down the throat of another creature, the entire bottle is used, and the creature gains the benefit of 1d6 doses (max equal to the constitution bonus of the creature, minimum of 1). The bottle may also be chugged as a full round action, allowing the creature to gain the benefits of a number of doses equal to 1 + the creatures CON modifier. If the potion is instantaneous, apply the effect of each dose separately; otherwise, each successive dose increases the effective caster level of the potion by the caster level of the dose. </p>
        <p>Vintage’s methods of brewing and mixing magical reagents with alcohol have been lost to time, though PC’s with the Brew Potion feat may attempt to learn to duplicate his work in time.</p>

        <h3>Clasp of the Mind Scream</h3>
        <img src="images/clasp-mind-scream.jpg" alt="Clasp of the Mind Scream">
        <p>This strange device grants the ability to mentally communicate with others, yet proves difficult to control. It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell <i>shout</i> (CL8 DC16), though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect.</p>
        <p>The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Entwined Syrinx</h3>
        <img src="images/entwined-syrinx.jpg" alt="Entwined Syrinx">
        <p>This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any bardic performances made using the <i>Entwined Syrinx</i>.</p>
        <p>Anytime anyone attempts to play the <i>Entwined Syrinx</i>, however, they must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate bardic performance — even if the character is not a bard or cannot use Perform (wind)—affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the <i>Entwined Syrinx</i>. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the performers Charisma modifier + 1/2 their bard level (if any); the +2 Perform bonus is already included in this DC. This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the performance is interrupted.</p>

        <h3>Felhart</h3>
        <img src="images/felhart.jpg" alt="Felhart">
        <p><i>Felhart</i> is a <i>+2 bane longbow</i> crafted from the fiercely carved horns of at least two venerable stags and strung with a cord laced with silver. The designated foe that its bane effect functions against varies, being determined by the creature a wielder hates the most when the bow is first picked up (as decided upon by the GM). This bane effect remains the same for a wielder, regardless of how many times he’s used the bow. Thus, for one user it might be a bane vs. humanoids (humans), while for another it might be a bane vs. dragons. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow’s bane effect.</p>
        <p>In addition, once per week, felhart’s wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell <i>mount</i>. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows felhart’s wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart’s wielder to ride it unless the weapon’s bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle Animal check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone.</p>

        <img src="images/golden-dragon-kite.jpg" alt="Golden Dragon Kite">
        <p>This painted silk kite depicts a shining golden dragon. In an area with 40 feet or more of vertical space and in conditions of light to moderate wind, a golden dragon kite can be unfolded and raised into the air as a full-round action. The user can direct the kite to move up to 100 feet from him in a single turn (but no farther). Three times per day, the kite can cast burning hands. The spell originates from the kite but acts as normal in all other ways. This spell can only be reproduced while the kite is flying, a process that takes 1 minute to achieve.</p>

        <h3>Hand of Abendigo</h3>
        <img src="images/hand-abendego.jpg" alt="Hand of Abendigo">
        <p>This nearly perfect pearl replica of a hand is attached to a gold chain and can be worn as an amulet. Once per day, the wearer can animate the hand as an immediate action. The hand attempts to grapple an adjacent foe of Medium size or smaller, using the wearer’s CMB. If it succeeds, the hand deals 1d4 non-lethal damage every round it maintains a grapple. If the grapple attempt fails or the victim escapes the grapple, the hand ceases its activity. If any creature within reach of the amulet (including the wearer) attempts to steal anything, the hand activates and attempts to choke the creature. If the amulet is not currently worn, it uses the victim’s own CMB and Strength to determine the attack bonus and damage.</p>

        <h3>Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer</h3>
        <img src="images/pallid-journal.jpg" alt="Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer">
        <p>This battered, leather-bound book looks like an aged and heavily worn notebook. Anyone reading the journal for an hour or more has strange dreams the following night, the details of which he cannot remember. The following day the character is fatigued. Reading the journal for a total of 24 hours or more causes the reader to have a prophetic dream wherein he sees his own death—though, as before, he cannot remember the details. If a character who has had this vision comes near death at any point afterward, at the moment he is about to die he may reroll any failed saving throw made within the last round or force an opponent to reroll a killing attack. The character must accept the result of the second roll, regardless of its outcome. </p>
        <p>Once a character has had the opportunity to avert death, regardless of its success or failure, the journal provides no more benefit and never aids the character again.</p>
        <p>The <i>Dream Journal of the Pallid Seer</i> is affected by a permanent <i>magic aura</i> that makes it appear to be nonmagical.</p>

        <img src="images/kybwaka-war-mask.jpg" alt="Kybwa'ka War Mask">
        <p>This oversized wooden mask covers the face and extends down to a point at the wearer’s waist, covering most of his chest and abdomen. It is simplistically carved as a stylized, bestial face distorted with rage or nightmarish styles. The light wood provides little protection, yet is magically reinforced to grant a +1 armor bonus. In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. </p>

        <h3>Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury</h3>
        <img src="images/ocr-mothers-fury.jpg" alt="Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury">
        <p>This small statuette—carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone—is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears of a fallen orc’s blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around the neck.</p>
        <p>The figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the Diehard feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the Diehard feat, he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit points.</p>
        <p>Whenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points, the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams and shatters. </p>

        <img src="images/avengens-unholy-symbol.jpg" alt="Avengen's Unholy Symbol">
        <p>This Unholy Symbol of Asmodeus dangles from a chain designed to be worn around the neck or wrapped around the wrist. Found dangling from an upthrust broken spear, it is unmarred by the passage of time or the surrounding filth.</p>
        <p>This Unholy Symbol is filled with the intelligence of the destroyed former mayor, Avengen, and contains the vast sea of knowledge held by his now fractured and insane mind. A character holding the symbol in their hand or around their neck can feel his intelligence brooding within and takes 1 negative level that cannot be overcome in any way unlesss they are Lawful Evil until they are no longer wielding the Unholy Symbol. While wielded, they may use the symbols knowledge to recall any one spell cast earlier in the day, as though using a pearl of power of the appropriate level, once per day. They may also ask a question of the former mayor, who will answer to the best of his knowledge, though questions about topics other than Asmodeus, the Asmodean Knott, or the nature of undead are generally wasted (K: Religion +15). Contacting the mayors mind or activating the pearl deals 1d4 points of wisdom damage.</p>

        <p>This severed immortal Eyrines head was found inside the <i>Chelish Crux</i>. Once a general of Dis, a failed political gambit saw her body destroyed as she was kept as a trophy by her political rival. Eventually, she was gambled away to Mayor Dargentu Vheed who also kept it as a trophy as a centerpiece at the dinner table in his home at Delvehaven and then the Mayoral Manor House, before he angrily tossed her inside the <i>Crux</i> and forgot about her when she blabbed away some of his secrets. This once beautiful devil is now an insane, chattering severed head, though the information in her immortal (if fractured) mind may be invaluable.</p>

Made entirely of silver and encrusted with sapphires, this cup is mildly enchanted to be cool to the touch and keep drinks cool while enhancing them with a Caster Level 1 <i>tears to wine</i> effect. This results in the cup emmiting a light misty fog as it freezes the water in the air around it.</p>
