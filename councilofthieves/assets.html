      <!--<ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Journal of Dagio the Great</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/dagio-great.png" alt="Dagio the Great"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;">I no longer know what year it is, what decade it is, and having discovered that I will not die from the ravages of time, I believe it is time I set to pen and paper a record of my life, that future generations will be able to read of my legacy and know the great and powerful legacy of their god. I was once a simple rat and a magical companion to my master, a young wizard named Eros Glendower. He became enamored with circles, with its immaculate perfection, and the promise it constantly whispered of immortality. He realized that death is a price for common folk and that true nobility were beyond such things…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… It is time I write of my birth, or rather, my true birth. My birth into grand nobility, above that of the gods and peasantry subject to death. My master took us deep below the senate to rooms long since hidden to time. He drew a circle of diamond dust and began casting his spell. He was not worthy, however, he cast the spell wrong, and as the arcane magic filled his mortal flesh, he attempted to save himself by casting the magic into me. The fool! The spell consumed him, and in its wake, I was born, immortal and eternal, and I will reign here in the true senate of Taldor forever. From here, I control the most powerful empire in the world…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… I found his ashes again today. I had nearly forgotten what he smelled like, but the reminder of burning hair and roasting mage filled me with pity. I took what was left of his ashes and drew a perfect circle, spending hours making sure my calculations were exactly right. Here, on this table, his memorial will stand eternal, as the circle is eternal. The circle, which brought me immortality, will bring my power ever further…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… I stole my wand of power from the immortal guarding the library. My followers and I have settled in the Senate, where I sit as judge and god. From here, we weave the power of fate itself, drawing circles throughout the senate thus turning the wheels of destiny wheresoever we will. I send them to the ground above to bring back food and riches from our kingdom, and spread the circle wider still…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">… Lives are fleeting unless they’re round. I carved one weak peasant today with a circle and his life was spent, but with his body, I had the ink to draw more. The circles leaked down the walls, loosing their initial perfection, but showing exactly how the radius and circumference of the circle changed the power of gravity on the bloody ink. This showed me how wrong I was, my math only scratched the surface on the perfection of the circle before, but I will start again to define the origin of god itself. 3.14159…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">- Journal recovered from the horde of a large rat beneath the Senate. Picture found drawn within the cover, titled, "Self-Portrait of the Lord of Circle's." Excerpts selected by Hypatia Crabbe.</li>

        <h3>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</h3>
        <img src="images/smiling-sickle.jpg" alt="Smiling Sickle">
        <p>A sickle wielded by Mr. Smiles III, this sickle seemed ordinary until very recently. Now, events and plots appear to be in motion, and the Sickle appears to be empowered by the secrets and ulterior motives of an unknown force.</p>
        <p><i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> has revealed all of its secrets and is a <i>+3 Stalking Sickle</i> which acts as a divine focus for Norgorber and counts as a dagger for the purpose of slight of hand checks and sneak attacks. The wielder can use Perform (juggle) to attempt to disguise the sickle as a juggler's pin. Once per day, <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> can be activated to grant its wielder the benefit of <i>greater invisibility</i> for one minute. While under the effects of this invisibility, the wielder gains a +4 profane bonus on perception checks and a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls made with <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> against targets that don't know the wielder’s location. If the wielder drops or sheathes <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i>, they immediately become visible again.</p>
