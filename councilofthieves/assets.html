        <li style="display: none;">Notice to Trespassers<br> You may have noticed that you’re trapped, doomed to live out the remainder of your miserable lives here, seeking penance for your crimes. The only way out of here is to accompany me, Lord Vheed, as my mayoral badge of office unlocks the doors. I have left my spare key in here, just in case I have need of it, or in case one of you are worth more than the scabs and urchins of the street. The key is attached to a red flag, on an island, in a lake, at the far end of my vault. If you retrieve the key, then you are worthy to escape, and may take with you anything you find here. In the likely event that you are not, you may console yourself with the knowledge that your death will further the sciences, and your bodies and souls will be used for greater purpose than you could’ve achieved in life.<br> Best Regards, Lord Dargentu Vheed, Mayor of Westcrown</li>

        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/note-pathfinder-names.jpg" alt="MissingPathfinder List"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Mayor Vheed - </li>
        <li style="display: none;">Presented below is what I have been able to piece together regarding the Pathfinders who escaped notice after they sealed Delvehaven during the initial riots in the pre-Thrune unpleasantness. After the passage of seventy-some years, it would seem likely that only Sivanshin still lives, and if you wish, I can send my agents north to Nidal to attempt to find him. The use of grave tallow to interrogate those who have been dead these past several decades ironically makes them more available to interview than Sivanshin—provided we can find their remains, of course. I am happy to report that I’ve made some progress in that area.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">1. Donatalus Bisby: Leader of Amber Privateers and one of only two survivors of a journey to darkest Mwangi—he has firsthand knowledge of at least one magical artifact that could well serve our needs for control. It would seem Bisby was sealed inside one of Delvehaven’s lower vaults as the others fled, but I’m unclear if this was a voluntary sacrifice.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">2. Ilnerik Sivanshin: Bisby’s chronicler, a half-elf, Sivanshin fled Westcrown a week before Aroden’s Fall. Evidence suggests he fled north, toward Nidal, and with a stolen relic.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">3. Coriana Heavenscape: A Westcrown native and, if rumor is to be believed, an aasimar, Coriana remained in Westcrown and organized the Father’s Bulwark, one of many groups of rebels glorious Thrune smashed in the pursuit of establishing order. She was slain and her remains collected by the Sisters of Eiseth—I’ve got them sifting through their holdings in an attempt to find her.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">4. Loremaster Liriam: Delvehaven’s master of lore—no other would know more about the vaults below. Alas, no evidence of his survival has surfaced—like Bisby, his remains might still lie within Delvehaven. I do suspect he was the author of “Cugny’s Wedding,” and if so, your suspicion that it is a cipher may well be correct.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">5. Venture-Captain Aiger Ghaelfin: Aiger was certainly the one who ordered the sealing of Delvehaven. My early research indicated that he planned on fleeing Cheliax for Absalom, but further investigation revealed this to be false. He remained in Westcrown and fought alongside Coriana in the Father’s Bulwark, but was laid low by a Thrune wizard who petrified him and then smashed the resulting statue. Scuttlebutt among the blood bookie circuit is that the remains of the man’s petrified body have been in the possession of one of the lesser noble houses involved in bloodsport, but I’ve not yet determined which family (I suspect the Luccas). These filthy has-been nobles play well enough when faced with Thrunish agents, but without the direct aid of your allies, master, I’m afraid I won’t be able to learn more…</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Note found within <i>Chelish Crux</i> alongside a series of Ledgers, five oddly shaped candles, and the Poetic Cipher, <i>Cugny's Wedding</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Cugny's Wedding</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="images/note-cugny's-wedding.jpg" alt="Cugny's Wedding"></li>
        <li style="display: none;"><br><br></li>
        <li style="display: none;">This Poetic Cypher, written by Loremaster Liriam and titled <i>Cugny's Wedding</i> contains an odd meter, with too many syllables on the first of every three lines. Upon careful examination, that last syllable, assembled together, creates a second poem titled, <i>The Wave Door</i>, which seems to be directions to a cache of items - and potentially the keys to accessing the lower vaults of Delvehaven - hidden in an extradimensional pocket in Cutlass Cove. The poem reads as follows:</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><i>"The Wave Door lies within Cut Lass - From Wart three-hundred salt soaked feet Nor-east the pathfinder must pass. Grand Lodge light must show the way: Delvehaven's oath will cause the fray."</i></li>
        <li style="display: none;">Having been interpreted, <i>The Wave Door</i> poem reveals the following directions.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">1: The Wave Door is located in Cutlass Cove, above the waves of the cove itself and about 100 yards off the shore of the black sand beach on the northeast shore of the uninhabited island of Wart Rock.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">2: The Wave Door can only be opened at night.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">3: In order to open the Wave Door, someone must first activate a wayfinder to create light so that the light created falls upon the point in space above the water where the Wave Door is located.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">4: Once the location is lit, someone must recite Delvehaven’s Oath, a vow taken by all Pathfinders when they join Delvehaven’s roster, by making a Perform [oratory] check and 1 full minute of vocalizing.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Avengens Unholy Symbol</h3>
        <img src="images/avengens-unholy-symbol.jpg" alt="Avengen's Unholy Symbol">
        <p>This Unholy Symbol of Asmodeus dangles from a chain designed to be worn around the neck or wrapped around the wrist. Found dangling from an upthrust broken spear, it is unmarred by the passage of time or the surrounding filth.</p>
        <p>This Unholy Symbol is filled with the intelligence of the destroyed former mayor, Avengen, and contains the vast sea of knowledge held by his now fractured and insane mind. A character holding the symbol in their hand or around their neck can feel his intelligence brooding within and takes 1 negative level that cannot be overcome in any way unlesss they are Lawful Evil until they are no longer wielding the Unholy Symbol. While wielded, they may use the symbols knowledge to recall any one spell cast earlier in the day, as though using a pearl of power of the appropriate level, once per day. They may also ask a question of the former mayor, who will answer to the best of his knowledge, though questions about topics other than Asmodeus, the Asmodean Knott, or the nature of undead are generally wasted (K: Religion +15). Contacting the mayors mind or activating the pearl deals 1d4 points of wisdom damage.</p>

        <h3>Chelish Crux</h3>
        <img src="images/chelish-crux.jpg" alt="Chelish Crux">
        <p>This strange and baffling object appears to be a silver dodecahedron made of silver platted cold iron and measures about 5lbs and 6" in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune, and when one looks upon the thing, the observer has the unsettling sensation that they can see either too many or too few sides at once. Rolling the <i>Crux</i> makes it abundantly clear that the object is hollow, with numerous objects within sliding around.</p>
        <p>A <i>Chelix Crux</i> is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest, and functions the same way as a bag of holding when determining how long a living creature can survive within or what happens when placed inside another extradimensional object, with the exception that its contents do not errupt when placed within an <i>anti-magic field</i>, it instead becoming temporarily impossible to open.</p>
        <p>Once a particular <i>Chelish Crux's</i> combination is known, a character can open it automatically as a three-round action, though it cannot be opened by a creature with a weakness to cold-iron, silver, or evil-aligned weapons. Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal, with the objects inside appearing in the center of the sheet. An unfolded <i>Crux</i> automattically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheets four corners as a move-equivallent action, folding up around any objects that sit upon its face at the time. The sight of the <i>Crux</i> folding around an item appears as though the items are being crushed and snapped at odd angles, though when it is opened, the items inside are revealed to be unharmed.</p>
        <p>A <i>Chelish Crux</i> can hold up to 200 lbs of objects, but the physical size of the contents is irrelevant. Objects that would exceed the <i>Crux's</i> capacity are instead gently pushed aside by the refolding action. A <i>Chelish Crux</i> has a hardness of 10 and 300 hit points which regenerate at a rate of 12 per round, and can be forced open with a strength check of 28. If forced open, the <i>Crux</i> is destroyed, dealing 12d6 + 24 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects within a 10-foot-radius, including to its contents (reflex DC 25 halves). This fire damage bypasses any immunities and resistances held by creatures who have damage reduction bypassed by silver, cold iron, or evil-aligned weapons and deals double damage to creatures of the extraplanar subtype.</p>

        <img src="images/khazrae-kuelata.jpg" alt="Khazrae Kuelata">
        <p>This severed immortal Eyrines head was found inside the <i>Chelish Crux</i>. Once a general of Dis, a failed political gambit saw her body destroyed as she was kept as a trophy by her political rival. Eventually, she was gambled away to Mayor Dargentu Vheed who also kept it as a trophy as a centerpiece at the dinner table in his home at Delvehaven and then the Mayoral Manor House, before he angrily tossed her inside the <i>Crux</i> and forgot about her when she blabbed away some of his secrets. This once beautiful devil is now an insane, chattering severed head, though the information in her immortal (if fractured) mind may be invaluable.</p>
