            <br>Will you find your dreams in dust?
            <br>Or dare you claim the crown at hand?
            <br>Cast your sight beyond the throng,
            <br>All doubt and weakness lie forgot.
            <br>Sate the yearning known life-long;
            <br>By burning coin your dreams are bought.

        <h3>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</h3>
        <img src="images/smiling-sickle.jpg" alt="Smiling Sickle">
        <p>A sickle wielded by Mr. Smiles III, this sickle seemed ordinary until very recently. Now, events and plots appear to be in motion, and the Sickle appears to be empowered by the secrets and ulterior motives of an unknown force.</p>
        <p><i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> has revealed all of its secrets and is a <i>+3 Stalking Sickle</i> which acts as a divine focus for Norgorber and counts as a dagger for the purpose of slight of hand checks and sneak attacks. The wielder can use Perform (juggle) to attempt to disguise the sickle as a juggler's pin. Once per day, <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> can be activated to grant its wielder the benefit of <i>greater invisibility</i> for one minute. While under the effects of this invisibility, the wielder gains a +4 profane bonus on perception checks and a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls made with <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i> against targets that don't know the wielder’s location. If the wielder drops or sheathes <i>Mr. Smiles' Smiling Sickle</i>, they immediately become visible again.</p>
