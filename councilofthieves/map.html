    <h3><i>"Before the Age of Lost Omens, Westcrown dubbed itself 'the shining light of Aroden’s civilization.' Now, others taunt us and say, 'You can find anything, civilized or not, in Westcrown—except for Aroden.' Ignore outsiders — we know the truth. We did not fail Aroden — he failed us, though we Wiscrani held the faith! We embraced that adversity and replaced his betrayal with strength and order. The Hellknights paved our way and House Thrune walked it to greatness. I don’t blame them at all for moving the capital — this place only reminds you of past failures. Besides, better for a Wiscrani to make a living without so many priests or imperials around, and easier for those of us who deserve it to ascend to higher stations without them in our way."</i> <br> — Alcini Vitaron of Alcini’s Apothecary in Westcrown</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <section>
        <p>For eight centuries, Westcrown was a bastion of civilization and a symbol of national strength in Chelish eyes. As the city served as the center of Aroden’s faith, all Cheliax deemed the City of Nine Stars to be Aroden’s next home in the mortal world. The crown of western civilization rivaled Absalom as a destination of pilgrimages during the Age of Enthronement. Yet, with Aroden’s unexpected death, the once shining City of Nine Stars became the City of Twilight as Chelish citizens lost hope. Decades of bloody strife followed, and the only direction out of the chaos seemed to be the orderly tenets of diabolism. A city that once symbolized a people’s power now projects a people’s disappointment and despair. Hope has dimmed in the city, and shadow beasts walk the streets instead of Aroden’s clergy. Westcrown remains influential in its mercantile and military might, but also humbled by its lost faith and tarnished reputation.</p>
        <p>One of the most varied and sophisticated cities of the Inner Sea, Westcrown is an enigma. By day, this city reminds many of any city or country they know, either because of the varied architecture or because people from all across Avistan and Garund now call Westcrown home. The many religious sites, whether active or debased, continue to draw the pious, the curious, and the devious. Even the ruins of the northern city draw interest among those looking for less-than-legal materials or rare treasures amid the dangerous rubble. But once the sun sets, only the foolish walk out of doors in Westcrown, for the shadow beasts prowl every darkened lane and waterway.</p>
        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>Summer is warm with frequent storms, Spring and Autumn are temperate favoring rain and occasional storms, and Winter is temperate and prone to sleet or hail during cold snaps, but never snow. Houses are built primarily to stay cool, favoring high ceilings, with fireplaces being rare outside of the kichen. The city's sewer system is a marvel of ancient engineering, designed by the same geniuses who built the Arch of Aroden; this allows most Wiscrani to never think about or worry about drainage or sewage, despite frequent rains and the town being barely above sea level, with buildings being permitted so long as they are above the king tide mark.</p>
        <h3>Crime and Order</h3>
        <p>The primary forces of law and order in Westcrown are the dottari. They wear the city's mark - aroden's eye - stenciled in black over a red field on their shields and tabards. Officers wear a reversed mark (red on black) on their left arms, their rank rising as it moves from the shoulder, to the forearm, to a ring on their hand. Dottari always travel in squads of seven - six soldiers and one Lieutenant - with five squads to each Captain and at least three Captains reporting to each Major. Each rego in Westcrown has at least Two majors, reporting to their respective Durotasi, or Rank Warden. There are four Durotasi, one for the Regidottari - Palace Wardens - who guard Parego Regiconda, one for the Rundottari - Ruin Wardens - which maintain the prison district of Rego Cader, one for the Condottari - Canal Wardens - which maintain security for the Westchannel, Dhaenflow, and the city's various cannals, and one for the regular Dottari which patrol the streets and operate the gates. Each Durotasi in turn reports to the Duxotar, or High Warden. The current Duxotar is Iltus Mhartis, the oft-drunken nephew of the current Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi.</p>
        <p>A signature of Cheliax are the infamous Hellknights, knights of law who have pledged themselves to a specific order. Contrary to popular belief, hellknights are not all evil, and are instead made up of lawfully-minded individuals. The name actually comes from a group of vigilanti nights formed with the intent of stopping the white plague - regular murders and suicides perpetuated by an organization called the Path of Grace. These knights became wildly popular but resorted to increasingly severe methods to bring about justice. When arrested, these knights pledged loyalty to the King but not to the Church of Aroden, and became commisioned by the King under a broad mandate to do what was necesary to bring about the greater good of peace and justice, but were cast out by Aroden's faithful who called them by the monicker, "Hellknights." Hellknights have the authority to police all of Cheliax, usually searching for specific types of criminals, as well as the authority to judge and carry out judgement on the criminals they apprehend. The closest Hellknight order is the Order of the Rack, based out of Citadel Rivad - an old Taldan fort - barely less than fifty miles outside of Westcrown. The Order of the Rack is tasked with uprooting rebellion, and does so most prominantely by carefully curating the nations art, technology, and history, especially recalling all outdated written history of Cheliax and burning them in clarity pyres. The primary rivals of the Order of the Rack are the Order of the Scourge, which is the oldest and original order of Hellknights, focusing on uprooting all forms of corruption, organized crime, and abuses of power.</p>
        <p>Under Chelish law and tradition, the Mayor of Westcrown (or Lord Mayor, as its current officeholder insistst upon) controls the Dottari and the tax coffers that maintain city stability. Over the seven decades since the royal seat of power moved to Egorian, three mayors watched taxes dwindle to a fraction of their former sums, forcing many cutbakcs in services. When Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi was appointed, it was tantamount to political exile from the imperial court in Egorian for his long history of inexpert scheming. In the years since, Lord Mayor Arvanxi's affections for Chelish opera have seen him pump a large amount of public money inot maintaining and rebuilding various opera houses and entertainment halls. While the public see this largely as wasteful spending, it keeps the mayor from meddling in the affairs of most common Wiscrani, making him the best mayor in recent memory. The former mayor was Arthan Challas, who died suddenly, and who himself replaced Dhargentu Vheed, a powerful diabolist who vanished without a trace. Mayor Dargentu Vheed was appointed the same day the capital was officially moved to Egorian, and was renown for his frequent experiments and harsh rule.</p>
        <p>According to legend, the Westcrown criminal underworld is ruled by the crime syndicate, the Council of Thieves. Thought by most to be a myth, this council supposedly began over a hunred years before the death of Aroden with the uniting of seven of the most powerful gangs in Westcrown, eventually spreading to control the city's slave trade, drug trafficking, smuggling, bribery, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and assassinations. Supposedly, the leaders of this crime syndicate are now all wealthy nobles, holding nearly if not all the reigns in Westcrown, and controlling the city mostly through a combination of competing businesses, influencing smaller local gangs, and coordinating all the shipping in the city to ensure that whenever money changes hands, it lines their pockets.</p>

        <h3>Westcown by Night</h3>
        <p>Reports of strange beasts stalking the night first surfaced in 4676 AR, which was originally ignored and downplayed by the city's government. Rumors spread quickly of a return of the White Plague, but the tales were soon replaced by reports of a shadowy calamity at Delvehaven, the local Pathfinder lodge. The dottari were sent to stamp out the problem, but proved ill equiped for midnight hunts, leading to a temporary curfew being put into place for everyones protection. Now over 30 years later, this curfew remains in effect. With the dying of every day's light, businesses hurriedly close and respectable homes light lanterns outside their doors. The dottari light pyrahje throughout certain major streets and patrol between these islands of light carrying halorans. Breaking curfew carries a fine of fifty silver helms, though most dottari hurry such scoflaws along their way and inside. Despite these precautions, weekly tales of new deadly attacks on curfew breakers keep people cowed indoors, with every wiscrani having their own wildly varrying theory as to who these beasts are, where they come from, and why they continue to hunt Westcrowns streets.</p>
        <p>It is telling, perhaps, that when the shadow curse came to Westcrown, it's darkness fell first on those who would otherwise be its most dedicated opponents - the faith of Sarenrae. Shortly after the first rumors of beasts stalking the night, a darkness came upon the Temple of Sarenrae shortly after dusk, and when the sun rose, it shone upon an empty edifice - blood soaked the stone tiles of the temple floor, but no bodies were ever found. Declared cursed by the mayor at the time, it has remained closed to this day and stands as a memorial to those lost to the darkness.</p>

    <h3>Parego Regicona</h3>
    <p>The "Royal Altar" is the name for the central island in Westcrown where the royal castle used to be and where Aroden was expected to rule the world upon his return. More than 80% of the wealth in Westcrown is in this parego, which also houses the majority of the nobility in Westcrown, where buildings cling to past oppulance and ruins are replaced with more modern buildings. The entire parego is surrounded by a defensive wall and is manned by the better-paid Regidottari, which help keep the poor relegated to the rest of the city. Parego Regicona is further divided into Rego Corna, Rego Laina, and Rego Aerum.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Corna: The "Crown Sector"</b>
      <li style="display: none;"><b>The Korradath:</b> Once the great royal castle and seat of Imperial Cheliax, this massive fortified castle today is used fo offices, temporary lodgind, and neutral meeting places for nobles, rich traders, and ambassadors from far-off ports who need to be impressed or protected.</li>
      <li style="display: none;"><b>The Dorjanala:</b> This secondary palace of the Chelish royal family was built as a shrine to Aroden at the request for Queen Dorjana. Locals say the ghost of Dorjana cracked all the glass when a servant spoke of Aroden's death in the shrine. When the court moved to Egorian, the faithful claimed the Dorjanala as a holy site and formaly organized the Inheritor's faith there, declaring Dorjana a founder of the faith. Many saay the glass walls weep thankful tears every vernal equinox from sunup to sundown.</li>
      <li style="display: none;"><b>Vaneo and Vira:</b> Rego Corna is home to several noble families and their respective vaneo and vira. Most notably, the Vaneo Drovenge, Vira Oberigo and Vira Julistarc are located here.</li>
