    <h3><i>"Before the Age of Lost Omens, Westcrown dubbed itself 'the shining light of Aroden’s civilization.' Now, others taunt us and say, 'You can find anything, civilized or not, in Westcrown—except for Aroden.' Ignore outsiders — we know the truth. We did not fail Aroden — he failed us, though we Wiscrani held the faith! We embraced that adversity and replaced his betrayal with strength and order. The Hellknights paved our way and House Thrune walked it to greatness. I don’t blame them at all for moving the capital — this place only reminds you of past failures. Besides, better for a Wiscrani to make a living without so many priests or imperials around, and easier for those of us who deserve it to ascend to higher stations without them in our way."</i>
      <br> — Alcini Vitaron of Alcini’s Apothecary in Westcrown
    </h3>
    <div class="row">
      <section>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>For eight centuries, Westcrown was a bastion of civilization and a symbol of national strength in Chelish eyes. As the city served as the center of Aroden’s faith, all Cheliax deemed the City of Nine Stars to be Aroden’s next home in the mortal world. The crown of western civilization rivaled Absalom as a destination of pilgrimages during the Age of Enthronement. Yet, with Aroden’s unexpected death, the once shining City of Nine Stars became the City of Twilight as Chelish citizens lost hope. Decades of bloody strife followed, and the only direction out of the chaos seemed to be the orderly tenets of diabolism. A city that once symbolized a people’s power now projects a people’s disappointment and despair. Hope has dimmed in the city, and shadow beasts walk the streets instead of Aroden’s clergy. Westcrown remains influential in its mercantile and military might, but also humbled by its lost faith and tarnished reputation.</p>
        <p>One of the most varied and sophisticated cities of the Inner Sea, Westcrown is an enigma. By day, this city reminds many of any city or country they know, either because of the varied architecture or because people from all across Avistan and Garund now call Westcrown home. The many religious sites, whether active or debased, continue to draw the pious, the curious, and the devious. Even the ruins of the northern city draw interest among those looking for less-than-legal materials or rare treasures amid the dangerous rubble. But once the sun sets, only the foolish walk out of doors in Westcrown, for the shadow beasts prowl every darkened lane and waterway.</p>
        <h3>Climate and Construction</h3>
        <p>Summer is warm with frequent storms, Spring and Autumn are temperate favoring rain and occasional storms, and Winter is temperate and prone to sleet or hail during cold snaps, but never snow. Houses are built primarily to stay cool, favoring high ceilings, with fireplaces being rare outside of the kichen. The city's numerous navagable canals and channels mean more people travel the city by boat or flat-bottomed barges called adels than by horse or carriage. The city's sewer system is a marvel of ancient engineering, designed by the same geniuses who built the Arch of Aroden - a series of canal locks for raising and lowering the water level for ships traveling up and down the Adivian River; this allows most Wiscrani to never think about or worry about drainage or sewage, despite frequent rains and the town being barely above sea level, with buildings being permitted so long as they are above the king tide mark. Buildings in Westcrown are typically several stories tall and built of stone, with even the city's squalid tenements having stone foundations beneath their wooden construction. Slate-shingle roofs are common throughout, and streets are usually cobbled and rarely run in straight lines; in the poorer regos, the uneven cobbles present dangerous footing for the unwary.</p>
        <h3>Crime and Order</h3>
        <p>The primary forces of law and order in Westcrown are the Dottari. They wear the city's mark - Aroden's Eye - stenciled in black over a red field on their shields and tabards. Officers wear a reversed mark (red on black) on their left arms, their rank rising as it moves from the shoulder, to the forearm, to a ring on their hand. Dottari always travel in squads of seven - six soldiers and one Lieutenant - with five squads to each Captain and at least three Captains reporting to each Major. Each rego in Westcrown has at least two Majors, reporting to their respective Durotasi, or Rank Warden. There are four Durotasi, one for the Regidottari - Palace Wardens - who guard Parego Regiconda, one for the Rundottari - Ruin Wardens - which maintain the prison district of Rego Cader, one for the Condottari - Canal Wardens - which maintain security for the Westchannel, Dhaenflow, and the city's various cannals, and one for the regular Dottari which patrol the streets and operate the gates. Each Durotasi in turn reports to the Duxotar, or High Warden. The current Duxotar is Iltus Mhartis, the oft-drunken nephew of the current Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi.</p>
        <p>A signature of Cheliax are the infamous Hellknights, knights of law who have pledged themselves to a specific order. Contrary to popular belief, Hellknights are not all evil, and are instead made up of lawfully-minded individuals. The name actually comes from a group of vigilanti nights formed with the intent of stopping the white plague - regular murders and suicides perpetuated by an organization called the Path of Grace. These knights became wildly popular but resorted to increasingly severe methods to bring about justice. When arrested, these knights pledged loyalty to the King but not to the Church of Aroden, and became commisioned by the King under a broad mandate to do what was necesary to bring about the greater good of peace and justice, but were cast out by Aroden's faithful who called them by the monicker, "Hellknights." Hellknights have the authority to police all of Cheliax, usually searching for specific types of criminals, as well as the authority to judge and carry out judgement on the criminals they apprehend. The closest and most concentrated Hellknight order in Westcrown is the Order of the Rack, based out of Citadel Rivad - an old Taldan fort - barely less than fifty miles outside the city. The Order of the Rack is tasked with uprooting rebellion, and does so most prominantely by carefully curating the nation's art, technology, and history, especially recalling all outdated written history of Cheliax and burning them in clarity pyres. The primary rivals of the Order of the Rack are the Order of the Scourge, which is the oldest and original order of Hellknights, focusing on uprooting all forms of corruption, organized crime, and abuses of power.</p>
        <p>Under Chelish law and tradition, the Mayor of Westcrown (or Lord Mayor, as its current officeholder insistst upon) controls the Dottari and the tax coffers that maintain city stability. Over the seven decades since the royal seat of power moved to Egorian, three mayors watched taxes dwindle to a fraction of their former sums, forcing many cutbacks in services. When Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi was appointed, it was tantamount to political exile from the imperial court in Egorian for his long history of inexpert scheming. In the years since, Lord Mayor Arvanxi's affections for Chelish opera have seen him pump a large amount of public money into maintaining and rebuilding various opera houses and entertainment halls. While the public see this largely as wasteful spending, it keeps the mayor from meddling in the affairs of most common Wiscrani, making him the best mayor in recent memory. The former mayor was Arthan Challas, who died suddenly, and who himself replaced Dhargentu Vheed, a powerful diabolist who disappeared without a trace. Mayor Dargentu Vheed was renown for his frequent experiments and harsh rule and replaced Mayor Anvengen, the iron-fisted mayor and Thrune-Loyalist who took over during the Chelish civil war and disappeared shortly after House Thrune moved the imperial seat to Egorian.</p>
        <p>According to legend, the Westcrown criminal underworld is ruled by the crime syndicate, the Council of Thieves. Generally regarded as a myth, this council supposedly began over a hunred years before the death of Aroden with the uniting of seven of the most powerful gangs in Westcrown, eventually spreading to control the city's slave trade, drug trafficking, smuggling, bribery, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and assassinations. Supposedly, the leaders of this crime syndicate are now all wealthy nobles, holding nearly if not all the reigns in Westcrown, and controlling the city mostly through a combination of competing businesses, influencing smaller local gangs, and coordinating all the shipping in the city to ensure that whenever money changes hands, it lines their pockets.</p>
        <h3>Westcrown by Day</h3>
        <p>With light hitting the Arodennama first and last each day, most Wiscrani learn how to tell the time (in a very general sense) by looking on the ancient statue. When the light hits Arodens Eye's, the Dottari across their city blow their whitles, marking the end of curfew. By then, most Wiscrani have awoken and eaten breakfast, and they begin their day. By first bell, one hour after sunrise, most stores open and most workers need to be at work. Lunch is often taken between fourth and fifth bell, with dinner usually being between the tenth and eleventh bell. With the nightlife effectively gone, most drinking, theatrical performances, and general revelry tends to start after dinner, any time between tenth and thirteenth bell. This time of year, the thirteenth bell is the last before curfew and serves as a warning, with the Dottari blowing their wistles once sunlight is no longer upon Aroden's Eye, marking the official beginning of curfew. For the most part, the Wiscrani have gotten used to the terrors the night brings, keeping extra bedrolls handy for unexpected guests and paying close attention to the time when the evening draws to a close. Due to stringent property laws, even the shadiest Wiscrani avoid entering homes, business, or ruins without permission, as Wiscrani hold that poperty owned extends from the origin of lightning in the sky to the deepest caverns in the earth, and tresspassing is a heavy crime punishable by fines, jail, and possibly death. Instead, those looking for work tend to stick to the streets, with every Shrine to Asmodeus having a place for people to post advertisements for jobs, news, and requests, all under the watchful eyes of the church's Inquisitors.</p>

        <h3>Westcown by Night</h3>
        <p>Reports of strange beasts stalking the night first surfaced in 4676 AR, which was originally ignored and downplayed by the city's government. Rumors spread quickly of a return of the White Plague, but the tales were soon replaced by reports of a shadowy calamity at Delvehaven, the local Pathfinder lodge. The Dottari were sent to stamp out the problem, but proved ill equiped for midnight hunts, leading to a temporary curfew being put into place for everyone's protection. Now over 30 years later, this curfew remains in effect. With the dying of every day's light, businesses hurriedly close and respectable homes light lanterns outside their doors. The pyrahje light certain major streets and magically lit shrines to Asmodeus pockmark major intersection while the Dottari patrol between these islands of light carrying halorans. Breaking curfew carries a fine of fifty silver ferries, though most Dottari hurry such scofflaws along their way and inside. Despite these precautions, weekly tales of new deadly attacks on curfew breakers keep people cowed indoors, with every Wiscrani having their own wildly varrying theory as to whom these beasts are, where they come from, and why they continue to hunt Westcrown's streets.</p>
        <p>It is telling, perhaps, that when the shadow curse came to Westcrown, it's darkness fell first on those who would otherwise be its most dedicated opponents - the faith of Sarenrae. Shortly after the first rumors of beasts stalking the night, a darkness came upon the Temple of Sarenrae shortly after dusk, and when the sun rose, it shone upon an empty edifice - blood soaked the stone tiles of the temple floor, but no bodies were ever found. Declared cursed by the mayor at the time, it has remained closed to this day and stands as a memorial to those lost to the darkness.</p>

    <h3>Parego Regicona</h3>
      <p>The river islands (called Westcrown Island by outsiders despite the fact the "island" is actually eight islands seperated by stone-lined canals) make up the "Floating Palace," or Parego Regicona. Home to the city's government and wealthy elite, the Regicona is where the royal castle used to be before the capital was moved to Egorian. More than 70% of the wealth in Westcrown is in this Parego, where buildings cling to past oppulance and ruins are replaced with more modern buildings, and an exterior defensive wall, manned by the better-paid Regidottari, further defend the Parego from water assault while keeping the poor relegated to the rest of the city. Parego Regicona is further divided into Rego Corna, Rego Laina, and Rego Aerum. Click on any of them below to find out more about them.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Corna: The "Crown Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Once the most important real estate in Cheliax, this rego houses the government centers of Westcrown along with much of the wealthy and aristocratic elite. Spread out across three different islands with numerous waterways, most of the Vira's, Vaneo's, government centers, and corporate headquaters go right up against a waterway and allow boat access for the majority of their patrons, letting the employees use the street entrances.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Dorjanala:</b> This secondary palace of the Chelish royal family was built as a shrine to Aroden at the request for Queen Dorjana. Locals say the ghost of Dorjana cracked all the glass when a servant spoke of Aroden's death in the shrine. When the court moved to Egorian, the faithful claimed the Dorjanala as a holy site and formaly organized the Inheritor's faith there, declaring Dorjana a founder of the faith. Many saay the glass walls weep thankful tears every vernal equinox from sunup to sundown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Korradath:</b> Once the great royal castle and seat of Imperial Cheliax, this massive fortified castle today is used fo offices, temporary lodgind, and neutral meeting places for nobles, rich traders, and ambassadors from far-off ports who need to be impressed or protected.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Sostarlannex:</b> This annex cuts into Siraon's southern edge where two canals meet. Its northern walls contain carvings from Sostarl and his students showcasing Chelish military strength. For more than two centuries, Sostarl's carvings, statues, and wall art have dotted streets and parks all over Westcrown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Vaneo and Vira:</b> Rego Corna is home to several noble families and their respective Vaneo and Vira. Most notably, the Vaneo Drovenge, Vira Oberigo and Vira Julistarc are located here, along with the Ghivel townhouse and Corna barracks.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Laina: The "Blade Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Though no one now remembers the origin of the rego's name or the names of its two islands, it is now home to the Staviancara, the headquarters of the Regidottari, and the Vendajen University, a center for scholarly and mgical pursuits (under the watchful gaze of the aforementioned Regidottari). Neither locations are shown on the detailed map.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Staviancara:</b> This remains the oldest occupied building in Westcrown, its walls were built by Taldan salves at the order of Emperor Stavian I upon his conquering of the city. Over the centuries since, it has remained as a combination Taldan Embassy and minor garrison for the few members of the Taldan Phalanx stationed within the city in accordance with treaties signed and maintained.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Trivardum:</b> This large building was the seat of the Triumvirate, the heart of power for Westcrown until the coming of the Chelish Court. Now, merchants operate out of the former court roms and administrative buildings on the ground floor. The popular Tricalista inn fills the second floor with common rooms, private apartments, and multiple taprooms. The third floor is comprised of rooftop gardens and the opulant penthouse of the Taldan Ambassador, Vors Kyniar, a paladin of Iomadae whose distaste for House Thrune kept him from moving to Egorian.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Vaneo and Vira:</b> Rego Laina is home to several ambassadors, wealthy foreigners, and military and Dottari commanders. Some local nobles still maintain vira's in this rego, however, most notably, the Vira Grulios, Vira Salisfer, and Vaneo Dioso, with the Drovenge, Julistarc, and Oberigo Houses also keeping permanent residents at the Trivardum.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Aerum: The "Treasure Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Home to true rarities for sale in Westcrown, Rego Aerum is the youngest territory in the city, containing new-money residents, wealthy merchant shops, and beautiful parks for the idle aristocracy.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Miratanza:</b> "The Floating Market" allows island-bound sevants a place to shop for food and goods for their noble masters. Anchored in place, numerous platforms allow vendors to rent splaces or sell directly from their own craft, giving a place for the majority of the luxyry, rare, and magical item trade. The Condottari keep all transactions and business within the Miratanza, taking a commission on all goods sold inside the four red-and-black marble arches that vault over the canals leading into it.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Nightshade Theater:</b> The most popular and grand Chelish theater in Westcrown, the Nightshade Theater hosts the performances of the best operas, plays, and performances in the city. The theater has received lavish endorsements from Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi, who is almost always in attendance.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Slave Barge Dock:</b> Part of Rego Aerum's wealth stems from the slave barge dock, where ships filled with new slaves are unloaded and barges are loaded and sent across the empire. While hundreds of slaves transist these docks every day, no person may be legally bought or sold here, helping to keep non-essential persons off the Slave Barge Dock. Click on either of them below to find out more about them.</li>

      <h3>Parego Dospera</h3>
      <p>"Despair's Altar" refers to the ruins and downtrodden slums of the northern shores of Westcrown. Roads are often in disrepair, and running in the Dospera invites a twisted ankle or broken leg. The Dospera is divided into two halves, the northern ruined prison Rego Cader with the Rundottari sureshots on the walls around it, and the southern slum of Rego Crua. </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Cader: The "Dead Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Formerly Rego Plea, the home of the various "low trades" the nobility did not wish to see as well as some of the more prosperous regions near the Sunset Gate, this district grew in the shadow of the massive 30ft. tall Oberigan Wall - the original northern wall of the city. Within this section of the city the turmoil and unrest following the fall of Aroden did not end with Thrune's ascendancy to the throne, and Mayor Anvengen adopted a simple if heavy handed approach to dealing with the troubled district - he ordered it sealed. The Sunset and Oberigan Gates were ordered shut, stairs and access to the walls from inside the district destroyed, and the dottari garrisoned nearby ordered to shoot any who attempted to escape the district. Famine, disease, and anarchy brought a swift but brutal end to the last gasps of rebellion against Thrune's rule. Renamed Rego Cader, a scant fraction of it's original population still dwell within the ruined prison district, and seventy years of the practice of exiling criminals into the ruins has turned it into a dark and wretched hell for those trapped within.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Devildrome:</b> An old arena offering entertainment in the form of blood sports, the ancient Devildrome is also known as the Old Blood Pit and is controlled by the crime lord, Corhan, and his "Honorable Gents," which ensure that bribes are paid to the right people to allow them to continue and allow boats to safely and discretely come and go from Cader docks with paying customers and new spectacles.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Dusk Market:</b> The rundottari practice of 'policing' Rego Cader by longbow from the walls has minimized their casualties but also turned Rego Cader into a place where one simply vanishes from the sight of the law - almost literally. A few choice bribes to allow travel in and out of the district for those with coin, and the Dusk Market bloomed within the desolation. The market itself moves from time to time - typically every few months - before an enthusiastic duxotar's raids force it to move. Typically taking place in the ruins of once-opulent buildings chosen for decor and defensibility, the dusk market typically opens its doors for the few hours before dusk to those seeking any manner of black market goods, sin, or vice and able to pay for safe passage in and through the Cader. The dusk market is the heart of the narcotics and other contraband trade, controlled by a series of competing proxies and gangs.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Ramble Gardens:</b> Without continuous tending, the parks and gardens of former vira's either died off or grew out of control. While many are now weed chocked brambles, some other now-wild plants draw folk into the Dospera. These ruins shelter a number of heps and plants quite rare west of the Arthfell Forest, as well as several deadly plants like assassin vines and giant flytraps.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Old Temple of Erastil:</b> The old Temple of Erastil served the spiritual needs of the conservative folk who lived in this neighborhood, most of whom lived within a few hundred feet of the church and tan small shops out of the bottom floor of their houses. Since the rego was sealed off, it's tall belltower has served as a key vantagepoint, with the church changing hands between dozens of different gangs.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Locations:</b> Other less-notable locations in Rego Cader include Red Sara's, a Cader "delight" widely known as a brothel and drug den run by its tiefling namesake, Red Sara, whose succubus heritafe is evident in both appearance and manner. There is also the Last Stand Inn, a former dottari garrison in the district which has served as a lair for dozens of gangs before being taken over by its current owner, Vaxelle, who remembers Rego Plea and personally trained guards at the garrison where he now provides a shelterd nights rest to those with coin, barter, or labor in trade.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Crua: The "Blood Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Rego Crua once held the entire slave trade, tanning, and slaughterhousing of Westcrown. As a result of the stench and filth, the rego also contained the northern slums nestled up against the walls of Rego Cader. While a few still have money here, the further north one travels, the more ruined and abandoned the district becomes.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Blood Pit:</b> Sometimes refered to as the "New Devildrome," the Blood pit is an exception to the rule in Rego Crua, which sits at the northern edge of the city under the watchful protection of the Rundottari. This massive colosseum holds sporting events and the new thaumaturgic gladiators. Popular with the nobility and peasantry alike, bouts are held weekly at a variety of levels, though the monthly Hellcaller Champion Tournaments really draw the crowds.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Oberigan Gate:</b> This heavily reinforced gate is six storries tall and more than twice the depth of the wall it pierces between Rego Cader and Rego Crua. Its four doors, two porcullises, and two squads of Rundottari kep al threats out of the Dospera. The doors and portcullises are opened only one at a time when dottari receive orders to exile convicted prisoners into the ruins or let fleeing Rundottari retreat into the relative safety of the gatehouse. This remains the only gate into and out of Rego Cader.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Pleatra:</b> One of the largest building complexes in this sector, the Pleatra is a massive slave market complete with sizable common cels for unsold slaves. While there are other places to buy slaves in Westcrown, none have the quality of stock as the Pleatra. Any slave to be freed must be brought here by their master, and the master must be the same one on the purchasing records, before they can be issued their freedom papers.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Walcourt:</b> Once a center of worship, this place fell into disrepair shortly after the death of Aroden. Since then it has been deemed a haunted place, with abruptly ending flophouses and orphanages assing to tales of unquiet lingering residents.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Locations:</b> Other less-notable locations in Rego Crua are Baradin's Forgeworks and its massive combination foundry and smithy that produces everything from Hellknight Armor to dockworker's crowbars, Crevali & Sons Paper Mill which produces much of the paper needed in the other Parego's, Devil's Arms Inn, Keep Dottar, Runaway Flagon's dive bar, and Scarlet Playhouse's small theater. The Runaway Flagon boats a large sign featuring an escaped slave making a dash for a flagon of ale, and given its proximity to the Pleatra, there may be some truth to its suggested history.</li>

      <h3>Parego Spera</h3>
      <p>"Hope's Altar" occupies the southern peninsula of Westcrown and contains the still-thriving money-making lifeblood sections of the city that were formerly looked down upon by the elite. Unlike the Regicona, trade and coin rule here more than blood and politics, with the Spera containing most of the city's rising middle-class. Parego's Spera and Dospera are seperated by the Canaroden, the longest, deepest, and once grandest of all canals in Westcrown, and bridged by the massive Pegasi Bridges. Both bridges and the canal are decorated heavily and distinctly; the western bladewing bridge is depicted as a pegasus with swords for feathers and decorated with Wiscrani heroes; the eastern span is a depiction of Truemount, Arodens former pegasus; the Canaroden is decorated with depictions of Aroden, his holy deeds, and his 12 guises, all of which have been heavily defaced and have since mysteriously recovered over time. Parego Spera is seperated into three Rego's, Rego Scripa, Rego Pena, and Rego Sacero. Click on any of them below to find out more about them.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Scripa: The "Scribe Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> Once the center of bureaucratic work in the empire, much of the area was littered with printers, binders, scribes, and messengers. Now, precious few such businesses remain beyond cartographers, with the rest of the sector long since replaced with treade warehouses and ship-related businesses. Due to this change, the borders of Rego Scripa and Rego Pena have blurred considerably, with much of the non-specialized area reffered to more generally as Parego Spera.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Taranik House:</b> The Taranik House was originally owned by a scribe, Misirnis Taranik, who used her printing press to spread the White Plague, before she, her fellow cultists, and her house were put to the torch by the first Hellknight order, now the Order of the Scourge. The "low philosophy" of the destruction of this printing press motivated the creation of the Order of the Rack, which later rebuilt a garrison from its ruins. The house is currently commanded by the local Paralictor, Gonville Chard, and facilitates the order's mission in curating history and information, as well as providing a local mobilization point for raids against suspected dissidents or support against violence when the local Dottari are overwhelmed. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Locations:</b> Other notable and less-notable locations in or around Rego Scripa are Adeletti's Adeliers, Fort Spera, Limehouse Theater, Riverboat Inn, Visio's Tavern, Wandering Reefclaw tavern, and the Westcrown Shipyards.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Pena: The "Coin Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> This rego has rather blurry borders with Rego Scripa and is most characterized by the more lucrative trade houses with dibious political or monetary standing. This rego is also home to a rising class of rich merchants who, by choice or fate, lack the poltical clout or connections to reach noble status or catch the attantion of the Imperial Court.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Delvehaven:</b> A famously renown Pathfinder Lodge, Delvehaven reminaed openly active in Cheliax after the Thrune Ascendancy despite laws condemning the society. Suddenly abandoned under mysterious circumstances, its gates are permanently barred and chained by the dottari. None can say what brought such a curse down upon the lodge or what happened to the Pathfinders and their treasures, but very few believe Delvehaven's fall and the rise of the shadowy beasts are unconnected.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Rolan the Tinkerer:</b> This dwarven tinker shop, named for its owner, is most famous for building strange automatons. Using dwarven engineering, Rolan is often saught out for new building construction and occasionally for providing automated security for noble vira's and similarly wealthy areas.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Locations:</b> Other less-notable locations in Rego Pena are the Ducotrion (Dottari Headquarters), East Empire Shipping Company, Glitter Palace jewelers most famous for their engagement rings, Imperial Plaza with its popup market every Sunday afternoon after church, and Weeping Fish inn.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Rego Sacero: The "Priest Sector"</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>General Information:</b> This rego contains more shrines and ecclesiastical real estate (extant or ruined) than any other five Chelish city's combined. For centuries, priests and nobles alike kept all land east of the Arodennama cavant for Aroden's personal gardens. The land became a flashpoint of landgrabs and assassinations following the Last Azlanti's death, and is now home to a mix of reclaimed churches, modest businesses, and combination homes housing more people than any other Rego in Westcrown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Aroden's Rise:</b> Countless priests and pilgrims shapped this large hill into a double plateau that rises more than 200ft. above the rest of the city. Many in the city efer to the uppermost plateau as "The Vacant Throne," as Cheliax's former god never came to this home. The lower plateau remains a trading area focusing on ecclesiastical goods, while derelict temples surrounding the Arodennama are among the few obvious remnants of Aroden's worship in Westcrown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Arodennama:</b> Standing 90ft. tall from its base atop Aroden's Rise and shaped from massive blocks of white marble, the Arodennama predates any known Avistani history and all other extant structures in Westcrown. Clergy in Absalom claim Aroden's 12 quasi-mythic founders built the Arodennama with their prayers, sweat, and magic. The statue faces the Parego Regicona with its chest oriented to catch the first and last rays of the rising and setting sun. Covering his chest is a massive silver-inlaid winged-eye symbol, its wings spereading across his draped sleeves and beneath his arms. In the age since the loss of the God of Humanity, the area around the statue is neglected and populated with the downtrodden and deluded. The Arodennama still inspires awe in all who travel to see it, with neither time, birds, vandals, flying monsters, or vengeful wizards ever managing to stain the statue, and no tarnish darkening the silver Eye of Aroden gleaming on its chest.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Imperial Marina:</b> Established from a lien on Vira Roalmo and its shipbuilding fortunes, the Imperial Marina is built on the easternmost promontory on the river and establishes the strong imperial troop and naval presence in Westcrown.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Qatada Nassudidia:</b> The largest temple to Asmodeus in Westcrown, this four-story cathedral dominates the promontory as the tallest building east of the Arodennama. Financed by Houses Drovenge, Salisfer, and Julistarc after a failed attempt to convert the Sanqatada Cinqarda with a five-sided cathedral to Asmodeus, its great crystaline skuligh glows a sinister red at all times, drawing the most attention of all Westcrown's holy (or unholy) sights at night.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Sanqatada Cinqarda:</b> The six story "Cathedral of the Five Founders" predates all Andoran and Chelish memory. Like the Arodennama, the white marble building remains unstained and shining despite centuries of vandalism and soot. The 30ft. limestone statues that flank each door depict the five founders of the cathedral: Dotara, Palmor, Rixana, Adel, and Crucisal. Five Hellknights of the Order of the Godclaw protect the cathedral and reside nearby, maintaining peace between the various faiths.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Uralt's Walk:</b> Alongside the long northern ramp up Aroden's Rise, priest long ago built a series of steps specifically for pilgrims to ascent the hill both physically and spiritually. Aroden's winged eye appears twice on each riser, flanking a single word. Pilgrims who climb the 166 steps and read aloud each word per step recite Founder Uralt's Dawn Litergy to Aroden.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Vaneo Arvanxi:</b> The Lord Mayor's manor has always rested in Rego Sacero, though its currect officeholder has expanded the building considerably in terms of size and defenses. Nicknamed "Aberian's Folly" - a nickname Lord Mayor Aberian Arvanxi does not appreciate - both for the vast sums of money and seemingly endless renovations the Lord Mayor pours into it, Vaneo Arvanxi has uniquely lavish amenities and hosts frequent feasts and balls. Powerful magic prevents the uninvited from entering the Vaneo, under pain of death, and rummors say a powerful fiend rests imprisoned under the Folly as an infernal power source for the Vaneo's extravagencies. </li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Major Temples:</b> Rego Sacero also contains major temples to the faithful of Abadar, Iomadae, and Sarenrae, though the latter is no longer in use. The Bank of Abadar is at the heart of the city's economy, offering moneychanging and loan services, unsurpassed security of deposits, and impartial financial advice. The Temple of Iomadae is one of the few prominantely open shrines to the Inheritor, with most other shrines being private despite remaining the most popular faith in Westcrown, and focuses on upholding rights and preserving the heritage of the city's various shrines and monumnets to Aroden and the founders. The Temple of Sarenrae is a closed edifice, a memorial to those lost when the shadow curse fell and Westcrown fell to darkness.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Minor Churches:</b> Nearly any religion can be found either represented or alluded towards in Rego Sacero, though very few of the chaotic-aligned dieties have representation that isn't an outright trap. Most prominantely represented are the Phatasmagoria (Nethys), Noble Mausoleum (Pharasma), Allcomers Pub(Torag, with suggestions of Cayden Cailean), Sailor's Shrine (Gozrah and other Nature/ Travel dieties), and several contract-killer businesses supposedly dedicated to various darker dieties.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Vaneo and Vira:</b> Some of the notable Vaneo's and Vira's in Rego Sacero include Vaneo Ghival, Caneo Nymmis, Vaneo Ulvauno, Vira Khollaris, Vira Rosala, and of course, Vaneo Arvanxi (see above).</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Other Locations:</b> Other less-notable locations in Rego Sacero include the Avernesian Archives and the recently inherited Old Shrine of Aroden.</li>

      <h3>Fiugo Estra</h3>
      <p>Few Wiscrani live on the Eastern bank of the Adivian, the Fiugo Estra, as the currents and eddies of the river and the Dhaenflow swirl the city's sewage and trash along the eastern shore. The bank is marshy and prone to flooding, making it difficult to build upon. However, with the soil so richly irrigated and fertilized, the rolling hills above the riverbank are excellent for growing olives and grapes, with large viticultural Vaneo's controlled by wealthy landowners, providing the majority of the farmland for Westcrown in combination with the swampy Dhaenfends. A small number of docks and cannals allow goods to flow into and out of these areas, though many become tidelocked during certain times of the day or year. The distance from the majority of Condottari patrols and an abundance of tidal caves pockmarking the bank also make Fiugo Estra home to many of the smugglers and pirates attempting to get things in and out of Cheliax; the Condottari routinely flush these caverns when the tides permit, occasionally finding smugglers or crates of goods, but more often finding the bodies of those trapped when the tides came in. Just beyond the riverbank is the infamous Hagwood, the westernmost piece of the former Verdruran Forest's boundaries and the source of the fey still vexing Cheliax. Most of the Hagwood was burned away during the Chelaxian civil war and subsequent Thrune ascendancy, leaving the wood shriveled and pocked and scattering most of the few surviving fey into villages, sewers, and streets less hospitable and more populated than their first world habitat.</p>
