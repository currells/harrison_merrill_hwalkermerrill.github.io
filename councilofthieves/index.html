      <h2>How this works</h2>
      <h3><i>Thrown into chaos after the death of the god Aroden, Cheliax found a new spiritual guide to help tame the resulting lawlessness and destruction—Asmodeus. Dominated today by the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune, Cheliax is a land of inflexible order, like a rigid steel blade tempered in the fires of Hell. It is a land where nobility and virtue take second place to a ruthlessly imposed harmony. It is a place where talks of past glories are only whispered in the dark, where heroic ambitions are kept to oneself, and where normal people strive to blend into the safe anonymity of the crowd. It is here, in the country’s former capital of Westcrown, that the Council of Thieves Adventure Path takes shape.</h3>

      <h2>Campaign Details</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Campaign and Character Creation Details:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Alignment:</b> Chaotic Evil Restricted, Lawful-Any or Nuetral Good recommended.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Class:</b> No Bloodrager, Gunslinger, Kineticist, Mesmerist, Occultist, Omdura, Psychic, Ninja, Samurai, Shifter, or Skald. Chaotic classes, wilderness specialists, and classes with non-urban animal companions are discouraged.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Currency:</b> Cheliax uses copper oars, silver ferries, gold helms, and platinum cabins, with silver ferries being the standard coin in market circulation. They also use silver tithes, which are platted with infernal iconography (and cursed via contract to prevent counterfeit) worth 2 gold helms, and they also have an uncommon amount of Infernal Silver in circulation, worth the same as 1,000 silver ferries, or 100 gold helms. Silver tithes were made as a single-coin substitute for the standard payments to the Church of Asmodeus, and Infernal Silver is the standard currency for dealing with Devils, though neither of those coins are widely accepted outside of the empire except in Hell itself.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Languages:</b> Official: Common (aka Taldane), Infernal. Recommended: Abyssal, Aklo, Azlanti, Celestial, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Halfling, Ignan, Necril, Osiriani, Shadowtongue (aka Whisprin), Tien (aka Tian Common), and Varisian.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Leadership:</b> The Leadership feat may be taken (along with its Ultimate Intrigue variants), though cohorts must be recruited from within the organization membership.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Origins:</b> Must be born and raised in Westcrown, though they may have traveled elsewhere for a time.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Race:</b> Restricted: Core races (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling), and Tiefling. The following may also be played, but not by more than one player at a time: Catfolk, Dhampir, Fetchling, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Ifrit, Oread, Strix, Sylph, and Undine. Due to racial descrimination and slavery, human races or the pass for human trait or feat are highly recommended.</li>

      <h2>Campaign Traits</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Trait Options: Players must choose ONE of these traits upon character creation:</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Child of Infamy:</b> Your family has long been in show business. Perhaps it was your parents, or an older sibling, or an uncle or aunt—whatever the case, one of your close relatives is, or was, a well-known and well-loved actor or actress. That this relation died in some compromising and embarrassing way has done little to alter your family’s name and fame—if anything, the unfortunate death has increased it. When folk learn your last name, they are quick to assume you live a wild life like your ill-fated relative, and whether you bask in this notoriety or do your best to hide your heritage, the years of association with the acting scene have had their effect. You’ve certainly inherited your relative’s talents, and are a larger-than-life figure, a melodramatic attention-hound, or a sly manipulator of emotions. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (act) skill checks, and the skill is always considered a class skill for you. Furthermore, you’ve inherited some of your relative’s funds, and begin play with a nest egg of 300 gp that you can spend however you wish.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Conspiracy Hunter:</b> You’ve long heard rumors of dark deeds afoot in Westcrown. Shipments of valuable cargo that go missing with nary a trace or question asked. People who disappear as though they never existed. Lords of business and nobles who speak in veiled references and accidental slips of masters even they must obey. What lords rule the Westcrown underworld? Do the tales of far-reaching criminal organizations hold a hint of truth? Could the fabled Council of Thieves, said to have been purged from the city ages ago, have somehow survived or reformed? And what hold do they hold over the city today? You don’t know, but you’re determined to find out! Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Perception, Sense Motive, or Stealth. You gain a +1 trait bonus on this skill and it is always considered a class skill for you.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Diabolist Raised:</b> All your life you’ve lived within the grip of devil-possessed Cheliax. You care little for the religion of your country, but that is the way of life in the most magnificent empire in the world, and who are you to question the faith of the empire’s rulers? Certainly not a fool like some of your more idealistic acquaintances, possessed of bizarre ideals about personal freedoms and egalitarian rulership—who can say whatever happened to them? You know of Hell and the rigidity of its grim rulers, you’ve seen devils and how they might be employed to the betterment of those with the might to control them, and you know of the dark faith of your country. You might not be a devil worshiper yourself, but there are realities to living in Cheliax, and it’s always good to know what’s really going on behind the scenes. Your knowledge of diabolism grants you a +1 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks made against Westcrown’s nobility, and a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against mindaffecting attacks from devils.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Infernal Bastard:</b> You are a tiefling. You might be an escaped slave, a hidden shame, or a homeless vagabond, but whatever your upbringing, life has been particularly hard on you. You have suffered greatly, nearly starving to death one winter, nearly being beaten to death by racist sailors one summer, and so on. Whether or not these experiences have made you a bitter and cynical scoundrel or a pious and hopeful optimist is up to you, but one thing is certain—you are something less than even your tiefling kin. Perhaps it is a result of your hard life, or perhaps it is due to some fault in your fiendish heritage, but you lack a tiefling’s standard resistances to cold, electricity, and fire—instead, you merely have a +2 bonus on all saving throws made against these effects. Likewise, you do not have the ability to use darkness as a spell-like ability once per day—instead, you may choose any one 0-level spell that you can instead use at will as a spell-like ability.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Shadow Child:</b> Westcrown has long suffered under a peculiar curse, a blight that rises every night, bringing with it fell beasts that hunt the shadows. No one can say from whence these night-horrors come—though some blame the mysterious wizards of Nidal, other claim that it’s some curse laid by fallen Aroden, while still others suggest some shadowy mastermind manipulates an ebon brood from the depths of Westcrown’s northern ruins. Whatever the case, the people of Westcrown have long feared the night, but not you. You’re goal is to reclaim the darkness from the beasts that hide within. You’ve acclimated yourself to the dark, and thus act with greater precision in the shadow than most. When attacking targets in areas of dim light, you do not suffer the standard 20% miss chance on attack rolls for being in the poorly lit area.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>The Pathfinder's Exile:</b> Westcrown’s dilapidated Pathfinder lodge of Delvehaven has long excited your imagination. Forcibly closed by the order of the city’s diabolical rulers, the Pathfinders of Westcrown were exiled, forcing them to leave behind untold knowledge and the treasures of countless expeditions. Today, Delvehaven lies under the pale of fearful rumors and dark magic, and bureaucratic red tape has prevented trespass on the lodge’s well-protected grounds. Having secretly and illegally contacted agents of the Pathfinders, you’ve expressed your interest in aiding their ventures in Cheliax—with a particular eye toward investigating Delvehaven, the source of your long-standing adventuresome interests. To your surprise, some days ago you received a message back from an unnamed Pathfinder operating underground in the country. Along with encouraging you to investigate the lodge and report your findings to the Grand Lodge in Absalom, he’s sent along a battered and tarnished, yet still functional wayfinder. You’ve promised yourself to pay back your unknown contact the 500 gp cost of the item someday, but until then, it’s yours to use. A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Westcrown Firebrand:</b> There’s something very wrong with the world. Spouses were not meant to huddle at their windows hoping and fearing day after day that their loved ones returned from work safely. Parents were not meant to hush their children when questioned about what happened to their neighbors. Citizens were not meant to avert their eyes and hurry by as guardsmen beat old friends in the street. The people of Westcrown have suffered long enough! It’s time for a change. But how? You’ve heard rumors of bands of free-thinking individuals meeting after the citywide curfew. Perhaps they might share your ideals? You are quick to react to opportunity, both physically and mentally, and know that it is with sudden and swift action that many conflicts are best resolved. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Initiative checks, and if you act in a surprise round, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls.</li>

      <h2>Religion</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle"><b>Click to Show/Hide Details on Deities and Religions in Cheliax:</b>>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Asmodeus</b> [Influence: 1st; Popularity: 4th]: The church of Asmodeus enjoys power and influence disproportionate with its popularity due to the influence of House Thrune; among those aspiring for power or prestige, conversion to Asmodeus is looked upon favourably by Thrune, and thus is a means to get ahead.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Abadar</b> [Influence: 2nd; Popularity: 2nd]: Although not the most commonly worshiped of deities, the church of Abadar maintains its position within the heart of Wiscrani civilization, managing banking and economic services on behalf of the new rulers, much as it did the old. Their economic role, coupled with the "working relationship" with Thrune and the dominant church of Asmodeus has seen them rise in influence since Aroden's fall.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Iomedae</b> [Influence: 3rd; Popularity: 1st]: The majority of Westcrown converted to the worship of Aroden's Inheritor when the god of humanity died, and so unsurprisingly her worship is the most common among Wiscrani citizens. Due to the influence of the church of Asmodeus, however, her church does not wield power in proportion with its popularity, as the majority of the city's leadership and elite pay at least lip service to Asmodeus.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Erastil</b> [Influence: 4th; Popularity: 5th]: Although rarely worshipped within the great metropolis of Westcrown, many families pay homage to Old Deadeye either out of tradition, or due to working the fields beyond the city walls.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Shelyn</b> [Influence: 5th; Popularity: 3rd]: Westcrown was once a bastion of culture and art, and so it should come of little surprise that the third most commonly worshiped deity is Shelyn, goddess of love and beauty. That said, in influence her church is below that of Abadar, Asmodeus, Erastil, and Iomedae.</li>
        <li style="display: none;"><b>Uncommon Religions:</b> Sarenrae and Zon-Kuthon. Other dieties are rarely worshipped, though none are forbidden (even if they're highly scrutinized).</li>
