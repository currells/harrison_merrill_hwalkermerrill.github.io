Not a chance! And why should’e? What’s in it for him ’cept the usual half silver a day and a ’nother chance to get his neck cut in the dark. Nah, you want justice, you come with me and I’ll meet ya some folks who knows how to get business done. It’ll cost ya—but then, ain’t nothing worth havin’ worth havin’ for free.”</i>

        <h3>Chelish Ranger 3</h3>
        <img src="images/janiven1.jpg" alt="Janiven">
        <p>Description: Janiven is an attractive woman who downplays her beauty by wearing rough clothing and armor and adopting a generally stern and no-nonsense attitude. Yet when she feels truly at ease with someone she calls a friend, her smile, sense of humor, and quick wit reveal her to be quite a charming and friendly woman. She’s known Arael for almost a year now, and has come to think of him as an older brother, and while she respects him greatly and approves of his dream to see Cheliax fall under the guidance of Iomedae, her own faith in Desna has often resulted in lingering arguments about when it is appropriate to toss aside the law of the land in order to ensure the freedom and safety of the citizens.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: Founder - Responsible for the recruitment, creation, and mission of the group, Janiven is ultimately responsible for both its existence, and the survival of its members.</p>

        <img src="images/arael1.jpg" alt="Arael">
        <p>Description: Arael is a handsome man whose family has long lived in Westcrown. He wants nothing more than to see the House of Thrune toppled, but knows that this is a long-term goal at best, and has set his sights, for now, on what he feels is a much more realistic goal—making Westcrown a nicer place to live. His frustrations with the government of Westcrown aren’t that they are pawns of the House of Thrune, but that they don’t do more to make their city a better place to live at the same time. He hopes that by founding a group of do-gooders, if not outright “people’s heroes”, he can show the city’s rulers a better way.</p>
