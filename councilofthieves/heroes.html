        <h3>Chelish Ranger 4</h3>
        <img src="images/janiven1.jpg" alt="Janiven">
        <p>Description: Janiven is an attractive woman who downplays her beauty by wearing rough clothing and armor and adopting a generally stern and no-nonsense attitude. Yet when she feels truly at ease with someone she calls a friend, her smile, sense of humor, and quick wit reveal her to be quite a charming and friendly woman. She’s known Arael for almost a year now, and has come to think of him as an older brother, and while she respects him greatly and approves of his dream to see Cheliax fall under the guidance of Iomedae, her own faith in Desna has often resulted in lingering arguments about when it is appropriate to toss aside the law of the land in order to ensure the freedom and safety of the citizens.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: Founder - Responsible for the recruitment, creation, and mission of the group, Janiven is ultimately responsible for both its existence, and the survival of its members.</p>
        <p>Boon: Janiven coordinates group efforts, plans missions, directs agents, and makes contacts. Despite her paranoia, she is very discerning and has a key intuition as to how useful someone might be, allowing her to find and bring in potential recruits.</p>

        <h2>Arael</h2>

        <img src="images/arael1.jpg" alt="Arael">
        <p>Description: Arael is a handsome man whose family has long lived in Westcrown. He wants nothing more than to see the House of Thrune toppled, but knows that this is a long-term goal at best, and has set his sights, for now, on what he feels is a much more realistic goal—making Westcrown a nicer place to live. His frustrations with the government of Westcrown aren’t that they are pawns of the House of Thrune, but that they don’t do more to make their city a better place to live at the same time. He hopes that by founding a group of do-gooders, if not outright “people’s heroes”, he can show the city’s rulers a better way.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: Sanctuary - A crafter, counselor, and spiritual adviser, Arael attempts to tend to the spiritual and emotional needs of the group, while providing a safe space to live and meet.</p>
        <p>Boon: Arael effectively administrates the shrine and ministers to its inhabitants and parishioners, providing a place where members may rest, heal, eat, train, have legal shelter, and recover from afflictions. He also provides spellcasting and potions services at cost.</p>

        <h3>Tian Bard 1 Expert 1</h3>
        <img src="images/amaya1.jpg" alt="Amaya">
        <p>Description: Amaya is a well-mannered glassblower and an incredibly beautiful woman who is somewhat self-conscious about the effect her appearance has on others – she dresses plainly as a result. She hopes someday to visit her distant kin who still live in Magnimar and Sandpoint.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: The Messenger - Amaya's magic specializes in communication. Combined with her knowledge of the city and its nobility, she can quickly get messages back and forth.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Amaya can be used to bring needed items or gear to the party while on a mission. Once per mission, the party can send a mental request to Amaya to fetch gear (up to 500gp in value) for them from the city. This takes 1 hour to accomplish. If the party returns to the fall-back point after this time, it will be waiting for them there, though Amaya will expect to be reimbursed upon delivery.</p>

        <h3>Chelish Fighter 2</h3>

        <p>Description: Ermolos is incredibly muscular, a physique the result of a long apprenticeship as a blacksmith. He walks with a slight limp – a lingering effect of a childhood illness. His father and namesake was an adventurer who vanished on an ill-fated journey to Thuvia several years ago — Ermolos still clings to the hope to someday travel across the Inner Sea to find him.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: Master of Arms - Ermolos's blacksmith training allows him to adjust and enhance the metal of his allies.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Ermolos can improve the PC's armor, reducing the armor check penalty by 1 and granting the armor the fitted armor modification. This takes 1 hour for light armor, 4 hours for medium armor, and 8 hours for heavy armor, and the benefit only applies to the person fitted for the person fitted for the armor, though other creatures may wear the armor normally. In adition, Ermolos can also attach armor attachments for the cost of materials (such as armor spikes) and size down armor one size category for free, using the same time rules as above. Ermolos is not skilled enough to adjust magical armor with an enhancement cost greater than +3.</p>

She has a very real respect for Janiven and Arael after they helped her smuggle several halfing slaves out of Westcrown, and a growing respect for religion in general.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: The Medic - Fiosa is a skilled healer, even without her magic, and is a major help when treating diseases or poisons</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Her preparation for missions allows one PC to re-roll a failed fortitude save to resist the effects of a poison or disease once per mission. This may be done after the result of the roll is revealed, though they must take the second result.</p>

        <p>Description: Larko lives a simple life as a dock worker, but daydreams of his childhood in the hills east of Westcrown. If he ever saves up the money, he hopes to move out of the city and live the quiet life. He’s the strong, silent type, rarely speaking.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: The Guard - Larko finds that he does best when defending an area, and is most comfortable keeping an eye on things at the safe house. When out in the field, his training and warnings keep the party's eyes sharp.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Larko grants a +2 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised.</p>

        <p>Awakened Role: The Scout - Mathalen is peerless when it comes to moving around the rooftops of westcrown or sneaking along its alleyways.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Mathalen can scout out the outdoor areas of a mission location being investigated, giving them an outline of the layout, warnings about visible outdoor threats, and other such material. She only relays very basic details which are not always exact - Mathalen is still learning.</p>

        <img src="images/rizzardo1.jpg" alt="Rizzardo">
        <p>Description: After stowing away on a Chelish ship, Rizzardo found himself more-or-less-stuck in Westcrown years ago. He earns his keep working odd jobs, but switches jobs frequently as a result of his quick temper. He only joined because of a powerful attraction to Janiven, but has since grown to enjoy the company of the others, particularly Ermolos, who he insists sounds just like his little brother.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: The Schock Trooper - Rizzardo takes his role quite literally. The inconspicuous nature of his bladed scarf allows him to walk quite easily into the midst of his enemies before he reveals the true nature of his weapon and creating havoc.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon: Rizzardo grants himself and all allies on missions a +2 bouns on Initiative rolls if they act in the surprise round.</p>

He longs for a day when the laws of Cheliax can be reformed and sees this group as the perfect means to that end. </p>
        <p>Awakened Role: The Face – Sclavo speaks softly, but his words carry with them great weight. An expert at dealing with people, he finds himself speaking with the majority of Westcrown, quietly comforting civilians who have lost something or assuring others that his group will help them.</p>
        <p>Lesser Boon:  Sclavo grants the PCs a +2 circumstance bonus to all Diplomacy checks.</p>

        <p>Description: Tarvi’s parents own a prosperous jewelry store in Westcrown – the “Glitter Palace.” She’s worked there for years, but is far too witty and intelligent to do the job well.

Caring little for romance, she hopes to someday have the skills to create and sell magical jewelry.</p>

She can use this information to relay an outline of the layout, provide a warning about visible indoor threats, and other such material.

        <p>Description: Vitti is a strange, eccentric man who dyes his hair green and refuses to eat any food he doesn’t grow or catch himself. A talented woodcarver whose works earn him a modest income, he prides himself on the fact that he only carves on wood that’s been harvest from deadfalls and other trees that died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>Awakened Role: Tunnel Rat – There has never been much nature in Westcrown, leaving Vitti to commune with nature in an unlikely place: the sewers. He tames and trains an alligator named Leatherhead to accompany him and grows the most familiar with Westcrown’s underground out of all the NPCs.</p>

        <img src="images/yakopulio1.jpg" alt="Yakopulio">
        <p>Description: Of all the members, Yakopulio is the least religious – she wears her atheism proudly and her eagerness to contradict often sparks arguments amongst the others in the group. She works as a bartender (and moonlights as a pimp) at a tavern called the Bruised Eel. Most of the others don’t understand what Arael sees in the offensive gnome or what she brings to the table.</p>
