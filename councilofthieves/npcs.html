    <h3><i>“Some of my kind go years without realizing they are different.”</i> Trezzen felt power radiating off the summoning circle and from the feather-winged beauty standing within. He flexed one taloned hand. <i>“When I turned twelve my skin darkened and my claws came, and then there was no hiding it. She told her friends she’d never suspected what I really was. I’d thought things were bad before, but they got worse. No one would speak to me unless it was to order me around.”</i> He gazed steadily at the devil in the circle. <i>“I’m tired of it. It’s time for me to claim my heritage. Time to go to my real home.”</i>
      <br>For a minute, the erinyes stared at him wordlessly. Then she laughed—a low, malicious chuckle that echoed in the room. <i>“Oh, honey,”</i> she whispered. <i>“What makes you think we want you either?”</i>

        <p>Description: Renown for publicly berating her forces and treating them as little more than slaves, Durotas Lhiana Strikis maintains control of the Regidottari by offering higher pay and prestige, along with working the safer and more politically connected area of the Regicona. Lhiana herself has been a pawn and lover to at least three members of the city's nobility since her arrivan in Westcrown seven years ago, though she is unaware she is still considered a plaything rather than an asset by the gentry.</p>

    <h2>Council of Thieves by Order of Position</h2>
    <h3>Everyone knows the legend of the Council of Thieves. Supposedly headed by an actual Oligarchal Council of 13 specific jobs, all council descisions must be ratified by a simple majority with the Council Chairman voting in favor, or a 3/4 majority with the Council Chairman voting opposed. While they likely no longer exist, if they ever did, they supposedly controlled nearly everything in Westcrown since before the death of Aroden.</h3>

        <h2>Torble's</h2>
        <h3>Sewer Ooze Bugs</h3>
        <img src="images/torble.jpg" alt="Torble">
        <p>Description: These Ooze bugs are the unofficial mascot of the Westcrown Sewers. Generally docile, these ooze bugs love eating rats, keeping the Westcrown sewers (and streets) relatively rodent and vermin free.</p>
        <p>Leader: None</p>
        <p>Threat Level: Very Low</p>
        <p>Known Info: Torbles (called “chordoplasms” by scholars of strange fauna and “ooze bugs” by many others) are strange and fascinating creatures, curious in ways beyond what their simple forms might suggest. These strangely colored creatures resemble a cross between a tiny ooze and an insect. They typically have a bulbous, beetle-like translucent body, six legs, and long eyestalks with primitive sensory knobs on the end. Usually they take on green, gray, or pink shades, though they may be any color. Older torbles often tend toward the colors of large ooze predators such as ochre jellies, black puddings, or the colorless gelatinous cubes, though any relationship between them is unclear. The creature’s interior may be clear or cloudy, and has the same consistency and properties of the fluid that surrounds the brains of lower animals. After the creature feeds, however, its color temporarily changes to match the color of its meal—which sometimes remains visible for hours. Although a torble has no true organs, it has a stiff bundle of fibrous nerve tissue running the length of its body that helps hold its shape. When it rests, it retracts its antennae and legs into its body, similar to how a snail or slug withdraws its eyestalks when threatened. A typical ooze bug is about 7 inches long and 5 inches wide, and weighs about 1 pound.
          <br>Torbles fulfill the same roles as oozes and insect vermin: they hunt creatures close to their own size, scavenge corpses and organic material, and territorially attack anything they perceive as food or a threat. They gravitate to damp caves, city sewers, rotting logs, or corpses—anywhere they can find plentiful prey and not be disturbed by rival scavengers and predators. Because torbles are easily controlled by both ooze- and verminspecific spells, some isolationist clerics and druids use them to guard their secret lairs or process garbage when otyughs are unavailable or unsuitable.
          <br>Ooze bugs reproduce by creating internal buds that mature and migrate to the creature’s outer surface, erupting as inch-long, disgusting transparent things resembling a cross between a slug and a cockroach. These buds can survive the destruction of the parent for days, feeding off the corpse until they are ready to emerge and fend for themselves; this means attempts to eradicate an infestation are usually only temporarily effective, as the unborn torbles quickly grow and repopulate the area inhabited by the now-dead adults. Only if the bug-slayers deliberately crush the adult corpses or consume them with fire or similar methods can they be certain their efforts are successful in the long term.
          <br>Because torbles are sensitive to mental commands, telepathic creatures sometimes use them as guardians, distractions, or shock troops; even a lowly imp becomes a petty tyrant with a few torbles under its command. Torbles cannot resist such compulsions, unless they’ve already been telepathically commanded in the same round or have made a more significant bond with another.
          <br>Most torbles seem endlessly hungry and insistent on eating their discoveries before designating them edible or inedible. A torble can ingest nearly any fleshy, wooden, or bony matter, visibly dissolving such meals within their transparent bodies. Stone, metal, glass, and similarly hard objects prove resistant to their digestion, however, and pass through their system in a matter of 3 or 4 hours, floating suspended within their colorful ooze during that time. Once a torble has consumed something, it seems to retain memory of whether not such an object is edible—though many seem terribly forgetful in this regard.
          <br>Most torbles work in groups, coordinating their attacks like ants or bees, or forming large swarms that may number hundreds of individuals, though unlike colony insects they do not appear to have specialized roles such as queens and workers. Usually all members of a colony or swarm have an identical appearance—coloration, number of legs, and so on. They never attack others of their kind that match their specific physiognomy, though explorers have found caves with bulbous pink victors feasting on rent gray corpses, or six-legged varieties hunting down and killing four-legged intruders in their territory.
          <br>Torbles that get separated from such groups act wildly different, proving edgy and cowardly. Rarely attacking living creatures, a lone torble scavenges for whatever food it can find. Those who happen across individual torbles and offer them food find that ooze bugs instantly warm to them, likely following their benefactors for hours, even days on end. Those who continue such practices find torbles make dutiful pets, even if the skittish creatures often prove more comical than clever.
