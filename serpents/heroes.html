      <i>&nbsp;“'Oops.' That's the last word I want to hear inside one of these deathtraps. 'Oops' implies that something has just gone horrible, probably lethally, wrong. There are a thousand different ways to die in any one of these gods-forsaken pits, and when it comes to risking our necks for a grab at some of the most fantastic treasures these jungles have to hide, I'm telling you now, there ain't no room on my expedition for 'oops.' And you can all bet your shares on one thing: If your 'oops' doesn't kill you, I sure as <b>Hell</b> will.”</i>

        <h3>Boarded in Cheliax</h3>
        <h4><i>Carmine Hyena</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-carmine-hyena.jpg" alt="Carmine Hyena">
        <p><b>Description:</b> While you aren’t necessarily a native of Cheliax, you boarded the Jenivere at one of that country’s port cities. As the people of Cheliax generally know the Mwangi Expanse as a near legendary land home to strange beasts and exotic treasures, your views of the region have a distinctly romantic tinge, and the desire for fame, wealth, and adventure likely motivate your travels.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You begin the campaign with a detailed map of the Mwangi Expanse (this grants +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge [geography] checks made regarding this region) and 200 gp worth of mundane equipment to aid your exploration of the jungle. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Red-Hued Canines (Hyena, Jackal, Wild Dog, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Boarded in Mediogalti</h3>
        <h4><i>Verdant Spider</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-verdant-bear.jpg" alt="Verdant Bear">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Your travels have brought you to the Jenivere through the dangerous port of Ilizmagorti,  home to both pirates and assassins.  Perhaps you’re fleeing a price on your head, perhaps you’ve jumped ship from another vessel, or perhaps you’re merely looking for a new start in a land where the dangers make themselves more obvious. </p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your familiarity with subtle slayings and toxins grants you a +2 trait bonus on all saves against poison. In addition, you can pick one type of poison listed below to be immune to, having undergone a long and painful process of building up an immunity to its effects: blue whinnis, giant wasp poison, medium spider venom, small centipede poison, or spider vine poison. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Green-Hued Carnivorous Vermin (Mantis, Spider, Wasp, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Boarded in the Mwangi Expanse</h3>
        <h4><i>Black Heron</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-black-heron.jpg" alt="Black Heron">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You boarded the Jenivere in the Mwangi Expanse, where you’ve lived or recently traveled through. You harbor no illusions regarding the deadliness of the jungles, the creatures that inhabit it, or the peoples that make their home therein.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain Polyglot as a bonus language and receive a +1 trait bonus on all Knowledge (nature) checks regarding the jungle. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Dark-Hued Simian (Ape, Gorilla, Lemur, Monkey, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Boarded in the Shackles</h3>
        <h4><i>Whistling Kite</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-whistling-kite.jpg" alt="Whistling Kite">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Your last home was in the Shackles, a dangerous land of pirates and treachery, but also of fantastic opportunity. A life of weal and woe on the sea and amid the pirate controlled lands has toughened you to a variety of hardships.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Pick one of the three categories of saving throws — you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Musical Bird (Eagle, Hawk, Owl, Vulture, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>

        <h3>Boarded in Varisia</h3>
        <h4><i>Azure Leopard</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-azure-leopard.jpg" alt="Azure Leopard">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Traveling from lands far to the north, you likely have little experience with the jungle, its denizens, or its strange forces. Just as the lands of Garund are wild and exotic to you, so are you to them. </p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> This unusualness manifests in one of two ways. Choose to gain either a +2 trait bonus on all Bluff checks made against inhabitants of the jungle, or treat your spells with the mind-affecting descriptor as being +1 caster level higher when cast against creatures and natives of the jungle. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Blue-Hued Feline (Cheetah, Lion, Leopard, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Colonial</h3>
        <h4><i>White Bull</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-white-bull.jpg" alt="White Bull">
        <p><b>Description:</b> You come from a long line of Sargavan colonists, stretching back to Cheliax’s original expansion into the land during the Everwar. While your people’s control of Sargava wanes every day, and Eleder has functioned independently from Cheliax since House Thrune brought diabolism to the political forefront, you nevertheless maintain a hardy Chelish constitution and natural sense of survival. What took you away from home is up to you, but you return to the land of your birth on the <i>Jenivere</i> in the hope of putting Sargava back on the map.  Characters with this trait are Sargavan natives and might be returning via any city, but especially from the Chelish ports of Kintargo, Pezzack, or Corentyn.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks relating to Sargavan settlements and politics and a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against disease. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Pale-Hued Hoofed Mammal (Antelope, Buffalo, Cow, Goat, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>

        <h3>Get the Cargo Through</h3>
        <h4><i>Golden Snake</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-golden-snake.jpg" alt="Golden Snake">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Sea trade is never safe, even on the highly trafficked waters of the Inner Sea, but the way to Eleder is more perilous still. The ever-present hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego blows hundreds of ships each year off course, into jagged rocks, or directly to the sea floor. Pirates operating out of the Shackles Isles wait on the other side to take cargo from ships lucky enough to traverse or bypass the storm. Your job is to ensure a precious cargo aboard the Jenivere arrives safely in Eleder—what form this cargo takes and the nature of your relationship to it are up to you and your GM. Characters with this trait likely boarded in Magnimar, Corentyn, Ilizmagorti, Port Peril, or Bloodcove.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Your character’s history as a merchant or mercenary has earned her a respectable living, and you begin the campaign with an additional 300 gp in starting wealth.  </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Yellow-Hued Reptilian (Crocodile, Dinosaur, Lizard, Turtle, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><i>Jenivere</i> Crew</h3>
        <h4><i>Foraging Ibex</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-ibex.jpg" alt="Ibex">
        <p><b>Description:</b> This trip to Eleder is just one of many in a long career as a sailor aboard the <i>Jenivere</i> and other cargo vessels. Whether you joined the crew with the hope of one day captaining your own ship, as the means of paying your way to a foreign port with sweat and blood, or as a slave or indentured servant, you now call the ship home. Characters with this trait have likely been on the Jenivere since it departed Magnimar.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> Pick one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (geography), Swim, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and that skill is always treated as a class skill for you. </p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Verbatious Equine (Horse, Wild Donkey, Zebra, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Mwangi Scholar</h3>
        <h4><i>Chronicler Elephant</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-elephant.jpg" alt="Chronicler Elephant">
        <p><b>Description:</b> The Mwangi Expanse is one of the richest regions in all of Golarion, and also one of the most mysterious. Despite its history of countless years and its fostering of nameless empires, very little is known of the Mwangi Expanse by outsiders or even natives of the primeval, jungle - covered land. You have long studied the region and its lore, and count yourself among a small handful of genuine experts throughout the Inner Sea. The <i>Jenivere</i> promises to take you to the very subject of your fascination, and you eagerly await firsthand investigation of the deep jungles and cyclopean ruins of Garund’s interior. Characters with this trait likely boarded the Jenivere in Ilizmagorti or one of the cities of the Shackles or the Mwangi Expanse.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b> You gain Polyglot as a bonus language and receive a +1 trait bonus on all Knowledge (history) checks regarding the Mwangi Expanse.</p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Professional Large Mammal (Elephant, Hippopotamus, Rhinoceros, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Stowaway</h3>
        <h4><i>Shifting Frog</i></h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/totem-shifting-frog.jpg" alt="Shifting Frog">
        <p><b>Description:</b> Not all passengers on seafaring vessels are legal or even known to the captain and crew, and the <i>Jenivere</i> is no exception. Whether too poor to book legal passage on the ship or fearing discovery by customs officials in your home port, you or an ally stowed away on the ship in secret. This may mean that the crew doesn’t know you’re on board, or perhaps they do now but didn’t when the ship set sail. Characters with this trait might have boarded the Jenivere at any port, but especially in the cities of the Shackles.</p>
        <p><b>Bonus:</b>  You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to find food.</p>
        <p><b>Spirit Totem:</b> Stealthy Small Mammal or Amphibian (Rat, Porcupine, Salamander, Weasel, etc.)</p>
        <p><b>Totem Magic: This totem is still mysterious.</b></p>
