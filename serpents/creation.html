    <h1>Character Creation</h1>
    <h3><i>&nbsp;Heed these instructions closely, my followers, for herein lies my greatest desire in life - and in death. When I live no more, bury my flesh in the graveyard next to the crypt. Bury me shallow, and scatter on my grave the contents of the atelier's jars: four neothelid tongues, eight seugathi eyes, and a quart of dretch's bile. Do not bother will fell enchantments; these, I assure you, are already complete. Simply leave my body with its accoutrements and then, above all, cover my grave with worms. Take these creatures' measures well, my pets, for you shall see them - and me - again. It will all be clear soon.</i><br> —  From the will of Vladdon Bavonoda, mad wizard of Ustalav and the first Worm that Walks.</h3>

      <h2>Step 1: Consult the Players Guide</h2>
      <h3>The players guide contains many details regarding the campaign and is a great resource specifically for planning your character. Many topics in the following sections refer to the players guide or contain excerpts from the players guide. While you do not need to read the entire guide, it is recommended to read as much of it as you can, or at least open a copy of it while creating your character, to make referencing easier.</h3>
      <p>A copy of the players guide may be found <a href="/serpents/attachments/players-guide.pdf">HERE</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 2: Choose a Class</h2>
      <h3>Get an idea for the kind of character you want to play. Magic or Melee? Tactical or Straight Forward? Highly Skilled or Powerful? Team Oriented or Loner? Choosing a class is the first step in building your character.</h3>
      <p>While Sargava and the Mwangi Expanse play host to some classes more easily than others, members of all types have reason to journey to the region on the Jenivere. Be they natives to the land returning home from travels abroad or foreigners venturing into uncharted territory for the first time, characters of any class can play an important role in the Serpent’s Skull Adventure Path. </p>
      <p>There are no restrictions on classes in this campaign, though the Players Guide has some advice. Classes that rely on a certain degree of stable infrastructure, especially urban-focused classes and archetypes, may have a harder time through significant portions of this adventure. Characters with some ability to navigate effectively or have the ability to travel faster will find practical applications for their skills frequently.</p>      
      <p>The information below and in the players guide also contains recommendations for inspirations on how to play different classes in the Mwangi Expanse, as well as some archetypes thematic to this campaign.</p>
      <p>For more information on classes generally, visit <a href=www.d20pfsrd.com/classes>pfsrd.com</a> or <a href=www.aonprd.com>aonprd.com</a></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 3: Rolling Stats</h2>
      <h3>Stat rolls must be done in person with the GM, so they will not be detailed heavily here. Depending on stats, the chosen character concept and class may need to be tweaked. If the stats rolled are not to the players liking, they may choose to default to a 15-point buy.</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 4: Filling in the Character</h2>
      <h3>Every character has elements of the following. Click on each section as needed to expand the details. It is HIGHLY recommended to view each section in order, even if your an experienced player, as they each contain critical information for this campaign.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="asset">
      <section>
        <h3>Race</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-races.jpg" alt="Races">
        <p>Races for this campaign are partially restricted, and may be selected from the lists of races that are Either Foreign or Native, Foreign Only, or Native Only. While anyone may play as a race that is listed as Either Foreign or Native or Native Only, the races listed as Foreign Only may only be played one time (by any player) during the campaign. More races will be added to the Native Only list as they are unlocked throughout the campaign.</p>
        <p>Additionally, players must choose if they are a foreigner (including colonists born in Sargava), or a Mwangi native. Along with narrowing down race options, this choice affects how you perceive (and are perceived by) certain groups. If you choose to play as a native race that normally starts with common as a language known, you start with polyglot instead. If you choose play a race that does not start speaking common, your character must learn common or polyglot prior to joining the party.</p>
        <p>Finally, alternate racial traits represent a unique heritage. Up to one alternate racial trait may be chosen, but no more than one. Races marked with a (*) have a note regarding their abilities.</p>
        <p><b>Either Foreign or Native</b>: Catfolk, Dwarf, Elf, Half-Elf, Human, Kobold(*), Lizardfolk, Oread, Skinwalker (any), Tiefling, and Undine. If you chose to play as a human, please also choose your ethnicity (or tribe if you're a native).</p>
        <p><b>Foreign Only</b>: Aasimar, Changeling, Dhampir, Gnome, Halfling, Half-Orc, Ifrit, Locathah, Ratfolk, Strix, Suli, Sylph, and Tengu.</p>
        <p><b>Native Only</b>: Grippli(*)</p>
        <!-- <p>Locked Natives - Only Races: Gnoll, Halfling (song'o), Hobgoblin, Monkey Goblin, Orc, Vanara, Vine Leshy, and Vishkanya.</p> -->

        <h3>Archetypes</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-archetypes.jpg" alt="Archetypes">
        <p>Archetypes provide a way to tailor a chosen class to better fit the desired playstyle. Archetypes specializing in combating undead, fending off undeath, or preventing ones own death, will be particularly useful throughout most of the campaign.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment Chart">
        <p>Every character must have an alignment, showing their outlook on ethics and morality respectively. Each character must be either Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral ethically and either Good, Evil, or Neutral morally. If you have a hard time understanding these alignments, please consult your GM.</p>
        <p>The nation of Lastwall (the central location for this campaign) is Lawful Good, so characters who are Lawful Good or their immediate neighbors, Lawful Neutral and Neutral Good, are the most common alignments and will be most at home. Lawful evil and chaotic neutral characters are allowed, though discouraged, as it will be more difficult for them to get by in the game and interact peaceably with the party. True Evil (neutral evil) and Chaotic Evil are not permitted in this campaign.</p>
        <p>The motivations of the player characters by the adventures beginning should be out of a desire to be heroes, not necessarily out of a desire to do good or to attain glory - though that can certainly be the case - but chiefly to mitigate suffering, save whomever possible (at least to keep them from becoming undead servants of the Whispering serpents), and above all, to stop the return of the greatest force of chaotic evil in the land.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Campaign Trait</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-traits.jpg" alt="Campaign Trait">
        <p>Every player gets two traits during character creation. Players may take a drawback trait to get up to one extra trait (total of three). One of these traits must be used to select a campaign trait, which ties the character into the area and serves throughout the campaign. No player may have more than one campaign trait, and no two players may select the same campaign trait.</p>
        <p>Campaign traits are detailed in the player's guide and further expanded upon in the heroes tab and will not be detailed here. Please note, you may need to iron out your familial details with the GM prior to the game, and any money or items received from your trait cannot be spent before the start of the game.</p>
        <p>Some standard traits that go along well with this campaign setting and the faith-minded citizens of Lastwall include: Armor Expert, Birthmark, Child of the Temple, Courageous, Divine Warrior, Indomitable Faith, Militia Veteran, Reactionary, Resilient, Sacred Conduit, Undead Slayer, and Veteran of Battle.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Religious Views</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-religious.jpg" alt="Religion">
        <p>Faith is a cornerstone of Lastwall's culture, and nearly every citizen pays homage, whether casual or devout, to one or more gods on a regular basis. While selecting deities to worship is not required, it is recommended.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming majority of the people of Lastwall follow Iomedae, even if some of them still respect Aroden, followed closely by the war god Gorum, particularly among the many orc-mixed communities. Most soldiers worship both. Pharasma is also commonly represented throughout Lastwall with most citizenry grimly familiar with Pharasman funerary rites.</p>
        <p>Other gods commonly seen in Lastwall include the Taldan pantheon - Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Norgorber, and Shelyn. Less commonly, Desna, Torag, and the rest of the Dwarven Pantheon may be found, along with the redemptive Sarenrae, whose worship was especially prevalent around Roslar's Coffer before many of her followers were massacred in the orc raids. There are also many cults to the various Empyreal Lords, especially Ragathiel and Andoletta. Many small communities like Roslar's Coffer still have holdover traditions and worship to Erastil, even if most his the faith has eroded across Lastwall.</p>
        <p>Oddly, a number of crusaders returning from Mendev have taken to worshipping the redeemed Demon Lord Nocticula, with some adopting her as a patron of redemption and forgiveness. Finally, while the death of Arazni is an embarrassing shame that Lastwall cannot forget - indeed, the crusaders which founded it are, in a way, responsible for her demise - there are a handful who still offer prayers to her, either out of mourning for sacrifice, or out of a wounded sense of co-misery and hate.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Feats</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-feats.jpg" alt="Feats">
        <p>Every player gets one feat at first level, and every odd numbered level thereafter. They may also get bonus feats from their classes, race, or archetypes.</p>
        <p>PC's are recommended to dedicate themselves to one or more combat feat trees. With undead as a common feature, feats like Power Attack and Cleave will be handy, as will be feats that boost Fortitude and Will saving throws. The Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat will aid spellcasters in engaging incorporeal undead, and feats augmenting channel energy class features will likewise prove useful.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-skills.jpg" alt="Skills">
        <p>This campaign has a survival-horror theme and likewise has much more emphasis on identifying and surviving threats or otherwise mitigating them than it does on dialogue. While no skill is ever useless, players will find that a diversity of Knowledge skills (particularly history and religion, with arcana, dungeoneering, geography, and planes also having their own applications).</p>
        <p>Players will also be confronted with physical challenges which may require the use of Acrobatics, Climb, and Ride skills. Perception is always useful and the classic adventuring standbys of Disable Device, Spellcraft, Stealth, and Survival will all also have moments to shine.</p>
        <p>Finally, every player may start with extra skill rank in a profession of their choice, and another rank in either a second profession, a craft, or a perform skill, representing their training in surviving in the Border Country. The most common professions in the area are architect, engineer, farmer, herbalist, librarian, scribe, and soldier. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/creation-equipment.jpg" alt="Equipment">
        <p>Equipment is an important part of every character. Each player has a certain amount of starting gold, determined by their class, with which to buy items. For this particular campaign, all players must choose average starting wealth.</p>
        <p>Players may buy anything they'd like that they can afford, though they cannot spend more than half of their starting wealth on any one item. Players also form a bond with a number of items equal to half of their charisma modifier (minimum 0), which may be changed each time they level.</p>
        <p><b>WARNING!</b> As this is a <i>Survival-Horror</i> campaign, equipment that you find will be limited or damaged, opportunities to buy/sell will be very infrequent (about 4 times in the whole game), and time to rest and craft will be nearly non-existent. Classes that rely on ready access to items (like ammunition or spell components) or specific magic items (like wands) will have a harder time, but characters with abilities that make it easier to get along without such things (such as methods of foraging for food, ammo, or spell components) will have a much easier time, especially at lower levels. It would be wise for at least one person in the party to know how to find (and cook) food, how to heal, and how to repair equipment.</p>
      </section>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Step 5: Finalization</h2>
      <h3>Please audit your character to make sure nothing has been forgotten. It may be wise to check your character sheet with the GM. Also, check with your GM if anything is confusing, if you need help with any of these steps, or if you are concerned about how something in your character build may interact with the campaign world or the party.</h3>
      <p>Your characters personality and familial details will also be important and need to be determined before the commencement of the campaign. Work with your GM to plan these, but understand that most characters will probably need: Likes, Dislikes, Fears, Aspirations, Parents, Parental Relationship, and Close Relationship Details such as information regarding a current or former spouse, sibling, or child.</p>
      <p>Double check your character, and make sure you know how your character fits in the community (whether or not they already know the other players). Whether they were raised here, are temporarily stationed here, came here to set up shop or find work, or thought hey were just passing through, your character should have been living in Roslar's Coffer (the starting location of the game) for at least the last year, and preferably at least the last ten years.</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">Some commonly overlooked items are:</b>
        <li>Calculating skill bonus totals, base attack bonuses, total health, saving throws, and combat modifiers.</li>
        <li>Choosing Spells Known and Spells Prepped.</li>
        <li>Determining your characters height, weight, age, and carrying capacity.</li>
        <li>Double Checking that all skills and feats have been chosen.</li>
        <li>Saving some spending money for the beginning of the game.</li>
      </ul>
