          <i>&nbsp;"Each month, my father walked thirty miles to the salt mines. HE stayed there for the entire month, working from dawn ;till nightfall, and sometimes longer. For one of two days, he's return, his feet dry and cracked and his palms rough as granite. When his brother came with the news of his death I cried, not because I lost him, but because I never knew him. So ask me again if these shackles hurt, and I shall tell you the same - you cannot hurt a Freeman."</i>
          <br>&emsp; - Olamuni Freeman, Soldier of the Freeman;s Brotherhood, as stated to a Sargavan officer upon his capture.

          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-aerys-mavato.jpg" alt="Aerys Mavato">
          <p>Appearance: Aerys is a trim, athletic woman with short dark hair, tanned skin, and fierce blue eyes. She dresses in tightly fitted leather armor and favors dark clothing and tricorn hats.</p>
          <p>Background: Aerys Mavato boarded the <i>Jenivere</i> at Port Peril, and immediately got in a fight with one of the ship’s crewmen when he made an ill-advised suggestion that he and Aerys could share bunks. Aerys soundly humiliated the crewman in the resulting scrap (much to the barely hidden delight of the <i>Jenivere</i>’s first mate), preventing further trouble during the rest of the voyage but sending the brooding half-elf into a self imposed isolation in her forward cabin where she spent much of her time half-drunk or passed out<!--, filling the gaps between bouts of work on her secret passion — poetry. Aerys has been crafting an epic poem she calls the Abendego Cantos for many years, and worries that she’ll not be able to finish it before she gets herself killed-->.</p>

          <h3>Gelik Aberwhinge</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Magnimar</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-gelik-aberwhinge.jpg" alt="Gelik Aberwhinge">
          <p>Appearance: Gelik is a spry, energetic gnome with blond hair and a neat goatee. He dresses like a noble at all times <!--(“If you can’t take the time to dress properly, no one will take what you have to say seriously — and they’d be right not to!”)-->. With liberal use of <i>prestidigitation</i>, his fine clothes always seem freshly cleaned. Only the ink stains on his fingers break the illusion of a proper gnome nobleman <!--(“If you don’t have ink stains on your fingers, no one will take your writing seriously — and they’d be right not to!”)-->.</p>
          <p>Background: Gelik boarded the <i>Jenivere</i> at Magnimar in something of a rush — when a local merchant discovered that Gelik had sold him a fake Thassilonian relic <!--(a practice that has resulted in his poor standing in the Pathfinder Society)-->, things quickly got out of hand and the Magnimar city guard became involved. After losing his pursuers in a market, Gelik found himself at the docks and, knowing that his welcome in Magnimar was over, secured passage on the first ship out of town he could — the <i>Jenivere</i>.</p>

          <h3>Ishirou</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Bloodcove</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-ishirou.jpg" alt="Ishirou">
          <p>Appearance: Ishirou is a rugged Tian man who appears much older than he is, with graying hair worn in a ponytail and a perpetual scruffy beard. His clothing and armor are well kept and clean, but obviously of low quality. Only his sword, a beautiful katana <!--given to him by a member of the Aspis Consortium to ensure his loyalty (and to increase the perceived debt he owes the group)-->, has any real value. Ishirou is rightfully protective of it, as it is his only material link to his cultural heritage.</p>
          <p> Ishirou grew up on his father’s ship, but grew to resent what he felt was a stolen childhood <!-- — he saw how those who stayed in one location set down roots, grew rich, and established empires. In a foolish attempt to force his family to settle down, young Ishirou stole down to the waterfront and lit his father’s ship on fire, only to watch in horror and shame as his father heroically leapt aboard the ship and tried to save it. His father died in the fire, and Ishirou’s secret drove him to stow away on an Aspis Consortium ship bound for Bloodcove-->. Ten years have passed since then, and Ishirou has worked as a sailor, thug, messenger, soldier, and guard<!-- for the Aspis Consortium the entire time. He boarded the Jenivere at Bloodcove, having finally paid off his debt to the Consortium-->, and is eager to seek a new life in Sargava.</p>

          <h3>Jask Derindi</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Corentyn</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-jask-derindi.jpg" alt="Jask Derindi">
          <p>Appearance: Jask is a middle-aged, plain-looking Garundi man with hair starting to gray and watery eyes.<!-- When the PCs first meet him on the beach, all he has are ragged clothes and manacles that bind his wrists behind his back.--></p>
          <p>Background: A prisoner loaded at Corentyn, this man is bound and sequestered in the brig.<!--Jask was once employed by the Sargavan government, but when he uncovered evidence of corruption involving illicit deals with the Free Captains of the Shackles, Jask confronted his superior, only to be betrayed and framed for the same crimes. Faced with imprisonment, Jask fled all the way to Corentyn, where he lived a modest life as a scribe for a decade. He’d thought his enemies in Sargava had forgotten him, but then a Sargavan agent caught up with him and put him in irons. The agent handed Jask over to the captain of the Jenivere with instructions to return Jask to Sargava for trial, but the captain disappeared during the shipwreck, leaving Jask alive but bound.--></p>

          <h3>Sasha Nevah</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Ilizmargoti</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-sasha-nevah.jpg" alt="Sasha Nevah">
          <p>Appearance: Sasha has tousled red hair and mischievous green eyes, and is missing the pinky finger of her left hand. She bears a tattoo between her shoulder blades<!-- — the symbol of the Red Mantis, a “gift” from her mother before Sasha’s personality made it apparent she could never belong-->. Slender and athletic, Sasha never stands still or stays quiet for long.</p>
          <p>Background: Sasha Nevah is <!-- a daughter of the Red Mantis, yet while she shows great promise — she’s--> a natural fighter, takes pride in her grace, and delights in violence<!-- — she’ll never make it as an assassin because of her insatiable curiosity and rebellious streak. Had her mother not been a highly regarded member of the Red Mantis, Sasha would have doubtless met with a tragic accident years ago. Sasha has little interest in joining the Mantis, as she rankles at even the thought of following orders.--> Impulsive and reckless, she’s <!--caused plenty of awkward problems for her mother — and while being sent to Sargava to assist with Mantis interests in Eleder is not technically exile, her mother has certainly--> made it clear that if she returns to Ilizmagorti, she’ll never leave it again. Sasha <!--understood what her mother meant (especially after she severed one of Sasha’s fingers to drive home the warning), but rather than dwell on the fact that her mother threatened her life, she--> sees this as a great opportunity for adventure.</p>
