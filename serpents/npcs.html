          <i>&nbsp;"Each month, my father walked thirty miles to the salt mines. HE stayed there for the entire month, working from dawn ;till nightfall, and sometimes longer. For one of two days, he's return, his feet dry and cracked and his palms rough as granite. When his brother came with the news of his death I cried, not because I lost him, but because I never knew him. So ask me again if these shackles hurt, and I shall tell you the same - you cannot hurt a Freeman."</i>

          <h3>Aerys Mavato</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Port Peril</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-aerys-mavato.jpg" alt="Aerys Mavato">
          <p>Appearance: Aerys is a trim, athletic woman with short dark hair, tanned skin, and fierce blue eyes. She dresses in tightly fitted leather armor and favors dark clothing and tricorn hats.</p>
          <p>Background: Aerys Mavato boarded the <i>Jenivere</i> at Port Peril, and immediately got in a fight with one of the ship’s crewmen when he made an ill-advised suggestion that he and Aerys could share bunks. Aerys soundly humiliated the crewman in the resulting scrap (much to the barely hidden delight of the <i>Jenivere</i>’s first mate), preventing further trouble during the rest of the voyage but sending the brooding half-elf into a self imposed isolation in her forward cabin where she spent much of her time half-drunk or passed out, filling the gaps between bouts of work on her secret passion — poetry. Aerys has been crafting an epic poem she calls the Abendego Cantos for many years, and worries that she’ll not be able to finish it before she gets herself killed.</p>
          <!-- <p>Quest: Aerys confesses that she wants to kick her drinking habit and asks for help doing so. While magical methods for recovery appear out of reach for the time being, she's heard that viper nettle berries can help to hasten recovery and ease withdrawl symptoms, and she asks that the survivors scour to find a supply of this rare tropical plant.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>Boon: She allows the PCs to read her unfinished epic - the <i>Abendego Cantos</i>. Anyone who reads it gains a +1 bonus on Will saving throws against compulsion effects.</p> -->

          <h3>Alizandru Kovack</h3>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-alizandru-kovack.jpg" alt="Captain Kovack">
          <p>Appearance: Smartly but practically dressed, Captain Kovack has a precisely trimmed bears and mustache, a crisp tricorn hat he wears when above deck, and a particularly-piercing gaze.</p>
          <p>Background: A Chelish man whose family has made the Magnimar to Eleder run for generations, Captain Kovack is pleasant enough with his passengers, but a strict disciplinarian when dealing with his crew. </p>
          <!-- <p>Death: Turned into a monster and slain by the explorers.</p> -->

          <h3>Gelik Aberwhinge</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Magnimar</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-gelik-aberwhinge.jpg" alt="Gelik Aberwhinge">
          <p>Appearance: Gelik is a spry, energetic gnome with blond hair and a neat goatee. He dresses like a noble at all times <!--(“If you can’t take the time to dress properly, no one will take what you have to say seriously — and they’d be right not to!”)-->. With liberal use of <i>prestidigitation</i>, his fine clothes always seem freshly cleaned. Only the ink stains on his fingers break the illusion of a proper gnome nobleman <!--(“If you don’t have ink stains on your fingers, no one will take your writing seriously — and they’d be right not to!”)-->.</p>
          <p>Background: Gelik boarded the <i>Jenivere</i> at Magnimar in something of a rush — when a local merchant discovered that Gelik had sold him a fake Thassilonian relic <!--(a practice that has resulted in his poor standing in the Pathfinder Society)-->, things quickly got out of hand and the Magnimar city guard became involved. After losing his pursuers in a market, Gelik found himself at the docks and, knowing that his welcome in Magnimar was over, secured passage on the first ship out of town he could — the <i>Jenivere</i>.</p>
          <!-- <p>Quest: Gellik knows of an old story about a Pathfinder Society ship called the <i>Nightvoice</i> that went missing in these waters, and the most popular theory is that the ship ran aground on <i>Smuggler's Shiv</i> or else sank near the islan. Admitting that he's currently on the outs with the organization, he hopes that finding out what happened to the <i>Nightvoice</i> could go a long way towards clearing his record with the society.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>Boon: Gelik shares several secrets of comedy. Everyone gains a +1 Caster Level bonus when casting spells with the charm or language-dependent descriptors.</p> -->

          <h3>Ieana</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Manimar</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/icon-ieana.jpg" alt="Ieana">
          <p>Appearance: Strikingly pretty with long, curly red hair and delicate tattoos in both prominent and delicate places, she moves about with an odd combination of graceful and awkward motions, like she doesn't quite fit in her slender frame.</p>
          <p>Background: A bookish Varisian scholar who tends to keep to herself, Ieana is traveling to Sargava to explore the ancient ruins there. Rumors aboard the ship alternately suggest that she’s the <i>Jenivere</i>’s owner, a Chelish agent, or Captain Kovack’s secret lover. Ieana keeps mostly to herself, and grows more intent on her studies with each mile the ship travels closer to Eleder.</p>
          <!-- <p>Death: Was killed and replaced before she got aboard the <i>Jenivere</i>.</p> -->

          <h3>Ishirou</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Bloodcove</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-ishirou.jpg" alt="Ishirou">
          <p>Appearance: Ishirou is a rugged Tian man who appears much older than he is, with graying hair worn in a ponytail and a perpetual scruffy beard. His clothing and armor are well kept and clean, but obviously of low quality. Only his sword, a beautiful katana <!--given to him by a member of the Aspis Consortium to ensure his loyalty (and to increase the perceived debt he owes the group)-->, has any real value. Ishirou is rightfully protective of it, as it is his only material link to his cultural heritage.</p>
          <p>Ishirou grew up on his father’s ship, but grew to resent what he felt was a stolen childhood — he saw how those who stayed in one location set down roots, grew rich, and established empires. In a foolish attempt to force his family to settle down, young Ishirou stole down to the waterfront and lit his father’s ship on fire, only to watch in horror and shame as his father heroically leapt aboard the ship and tried to save it. His father died in the fire<!--, and Ishirou’s secret drove him to stow away on an Aspis Consortium ship bound for Bloodcove-->. Ten years have passed since then, and Ishirou has worked as a sailor, thug, messenger, soldier, and guardfor the Aspis Consortium the entire time. He boarded the Jenivere at Bloodcove, having finally paid off his debt to the Consortium, and is eager to seek a new life in Sargava.</p>
          <!-- <p>Quest: Ishirou admits that he collects treasure maps, and while most are of places he'd never dream of visiting or have proven to be of dubious origin, one of them shows the location of an old pirate's stash here on <i>Smuggler's Shiv</i>. Alas, the notes on the map indicate that recovering the treasure wil take several people. Since they're already here on the Shiv though, what's the harm in looking for a bit of loot?</p> -->
          <!-- <p>Boon: Ishirou shares some of his swordfighting styles and tricks, granting everyone a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD against disarm combat maneuvers.</p> -->

          <h2>Prisoner</h2>
          <h3>Jask Derindi</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Corentyn</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-jask-derindi.jpg" alt="Jask Derindi">
          <p>Appearance: Jask is a middle-aged, plain-looking Garundi man with hair starting to gray and watery eyes.<!-- When the PCs first meet him on the beach, all he has are ragged clothes and manacles that bind his wrists behind his back.--></p>
          <p>Background: A prisoner loaded at Corentyn, this man is bound and sequestered in the brig. Jask was once employed by the Sargavan government, but when he uncovered evidence of corruption involving illicit deals with the Free Captains of the Shackles, Jask confronted his superior, only to be betrayed and framed for the same crimes. Faced with imprisonment, Jask fled all the way to Corentyn, where he lived a modest life as a scribe for a decade. He’d thought his enemies in Sargava had forgotten him, but then a Sargavan agent caught up with him and put him in irons. The agent handed Jask over to the captain of the Jenivere with instructions to return Jask to Sargava for trial, but the captain disappeared during the shipwreck, leaving Jask alive but bound.</p>
          <p>Quest:  One of the incriminating papers he found so long ago indicated that one of his superior’s contacts in the Shackles was a man named Avret Kinkarian. Kinkarian’s ship, the Brine Demon, reputedly wrecked here on Smuggler’s Shiv. He knows it’s a long shot, but Jask would love to track the ship down and explore the wreck on the off chance there could be more evidence somewhere aboard to prove his innocence. </p>
          <!-- <p>Boon: Jask shares a number of mantras and focusing chants. Everyone gains Meditation Master as a bonus feat.</p> -->

          <h3>Sasha Nevah</h3>
          <h4>Boarded at Ilizmargoti</h4>
          <img src="/serpents/images/npc-sasha-nevah.jpg" alt="Sasha Nevah">
          <p>Appearance: Sasha has tousled red hair and mischievous green eyes, and is missing the pinky finger of her left hand. She bears a tattoo between her shoulder blades<!-- — the symbol of the Red Mantis, a “gift” from her mother before Sasha’s personality made it apparent she could never belong-->. Slender and athletic, Sasha never stands still or stays quiet for long.</p>
          <p>Background: Sasha Nevah is a daughter of the Red Mantis, yet while she shows great promise — she’s a natural fighter, takes pride in her grace, and delights in violence— she’ll never make it as an assassin because of her insatiable curiosity and rebellious streak. Had her mother not been a highly regarded member of the Red Mantis, Sasha would have doubtless met with a tragic accident years ago. Sasha has little interest in joining the Mantis, as she rankles at even the thought of following orders. Impulsive and reckless, she’s caused plenty of awkward problems for her mother — and while being sent to Sargava to assist with Mantis interests in Eleder is not technically exile, her mother has certainly made it clear that if she returns to Ilizmagorti, she’ll never leave it again. Sasha understood what her mother meant (especially after she severed one of Sasha’s fingers to drive home the warning), but rather than dwell on the fact that her mother threatened her life, she sees this as a great opportunity for adventure.</p>
          <p>Quest: Sasha finds much of the local wildlife adorable, particularly the poisonous ones. If some can be found for her, she promises to look after them, take the best care of them, and keep them under control and out of the other's bed's. She would dearly love to have a baby black mamba, dimorphodon, and shiv dragon as a pet.</p>
          <!-- <p>Boon: Anyone who studies under Sasha gains a permanent +1 bonus on Initiative checks.</p> -->

          <p>Appearance: A youthful but weathered man, First Mate Devers has an easygoing attitude coupled with an impeccable sense of honor and duty which he strives to impart to the crew.</p>
          <p>Background: The <i>Jenivere</i>’s first mate is friendly with both passengers and crew, but he sometimes seems to chafe under the strong discipline of Captain Kovack.</p>

          <p>Rail thin and incredibly jumpy, Ship's Cook Terillo is most memorable for his shrill screams at the sight of all kinds of bugs. Meticulously clean, he keeps his blond hair cropped short and his beard and thin mustache precisely trimmed.</p>
          <p>Background: A taciturn man from Senghor, Ship’s Cook Terillo has served in that capacity aboard several ships, though apparently not on account of his culinary skills, which seem to be limited to watery soups.</p>
