      <i>"I'm afraid I must cut my expedition into this harsh, broken land short. Hundreds of islands remain from the once-great continent of Azlant, and hints of that magnificent empire still lie out in the open in some places. I’ve gathered what I can carry, but I’m afraid I had to leave many things behind. Eight of my porters fell ill and died a week after making landfall, the captain of the ship I chartered lost patience and left me stranded here, and I ran out of the rations I brought nine days ago. I must find my own way back home. If my understanding of Azlanti is accurate, I believe that I can use this shimmering metallic arch (which is in surprisingly excellent condition) and teleport up to three thousand miles away. I just need to find the right way to activate it. I have to make it back to Absalom in one piece; many people are going to want to read these chronicles."</i>
