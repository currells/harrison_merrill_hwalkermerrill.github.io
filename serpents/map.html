    <h1>Where Are We?!?</h1>
    <h3>
      <i>"The jungle knows no god but its own hunger. Mighty beasts enter, and not even bones return. Ancient rivers pour endlessly in, and are drunk down, every drop. Even spirits, given up beneath the canopy, become snared and tangled - dragged down amid roots and vines. But the jungle's hunger is not a dead thing like mine and yours. The jungle keeps what it eats, makes it part of itself, and grows rich and tall and ever more deadly. And amid its fat miles and heavy limbs what once were the ghosts of things that walk and crawl open new eyes amid the brush, and know a new hunger. A hunger like the jungle's."</i>

And they say that those who sail too close to the island's cutting edge are already doomed, even before their ships are impaled and slip beneath the shark-hungry waves. The island itself is a grave to all manner of folk - pirate and soldier, merchant and smuggler alike. By day, one who approaches too closely can hear their screams from the green that crowns the isle, and by night one can watch the witchlights dance on its shore, said to be glowing cannibal ghosts eager to lure new meals to their shore.</i></p>

      <h2>Destination: Eleder</h2>
      <section>
        <a href="/serpents/images/hero-eleder.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/hero-eleder.jpg" alt="Eleder"></a>
        <p>Appearance: Eleder is dominated by extensive stone docks, where ships from most nations on the Arcadian Ocean lie moored. The city is an unusual blend of architecture, as the gothic stonework of the colonists’ native Cheliax has adapted to the native building styles in favor of less stuffy, open designs that better combat the heat. Although Eleder itself is surrounded by a sturdy stone wall, the individual homes of many colonials also feature low stone walls and iron gates—a decorative concession to their roots that does nothing to make their homes less comfortable. These buildings are joined by more practical wood and canvas structures, and outside the city walls, countless mud-daub huts — the homes of the native workers — stretch far out into the banana, cocoa, and pineapple plantations.</p>
        <p>History: The original founders of Sargava selected a small, natural harbor as the site of their future colony, gradually expanding from a stockaded encampment to a walled city with a fully equipped shipyard. It was named Eleder after the daughter of one of the original colonists, whose gentle diplomacy and efforts to learn Polyglot enabled the colonists to live in cooperation with the locals. Though the city today is named for Eleder’s efforts, the first several decades were fraught with violent misunderstandings between Chelaxians and natives. Large numbers of Chelish troops were brought in to help bring the native tribes under control, and they gradually convinced the tribes to assist the colonists in bringing “order” and industry to their “savage” land. When Sargava broke from Cheliax with the help of the Shackles, the citizens of Eleder opened up their repair yards as docks to ships of any nation, provided they paid a hefty fee for the privilege. Eleder is now considered one of the finest shipyards in Garund, and certainly the finest on the western coast. With the appointment of Utilinus to the position of Grand Custodian, Eleder has even made a few strides toward attracting other foreign businesses — mainly merchants from Nidal, Varisia, and Rahadoum. But though he has gained popularity with the colonials, the Grand Custodian is not well liked by the Hurricane King, who heavily taxes the merchant fleets his pirates guide past the Eye of Abendego.</p>
        <p>Society: Eleder is a city of contradictions. The colonials live in relative luxury, while the native workers dwell in poverty outside the city walls. While countless scruffy sailors and explorers parade through Eleder every year en route to adventures in the interior — or simply on their way to enjoy the brothels and clubs Eleder maintains near the docks to keep pirates out of the city proper — the colonials maintain high personal standards of decorum and propriety. Although Grand Custodian Utilinus is Sargava’s authority, the elderly Lady Madrona Daugustana is the city’s unofficial leader. As the oldest living colonial in all of Sargava, Lady Madrona bears the responsibility of upholding the ideals and customs of her forebearers, and any major undertaking must meet her approval.While the majority of colonials consider the native Mwangi to be a “lesser people” than themselves, they rely on them not only as a labor pool but as a standing militia of poorly paid volunteers. Eleder’s Praetor, Commander Ezio Egorius, regularly drills the Sargavan Guard, which consists of mixed units, though all Mwangi natives are enlisted regulars while the colonials are all officers, much to the ire of many Mwangi veterans.</p>
        <p>Adventurers: Though Sargava relies on the influx of foreign money to pay its debts to the Shackles pirates, the Eleder colonials would much rather the seemingly constant stream of adventurers and explorers sail up the Korir River to their destinations incountry, bypassing Eleder completely. In the words of Lady Madrona Daugustana, “Adventurers merely pass through Eleder; we must live here when they are long gone.”The major problem most colonials have with adventurers is that the colonials are barely keeping the Mwangi populace under control as it as, and in their view, the last thing they need is thrill-seekers or would-be “liberators” stirring up the natives, either by picking fights with tribal warriors or speaking ill of the colonials to the workers.Adding to the problem, adventurers rarely bother to learn the local customs, let alone observe the agreements between the tribes and the colonials, and a single incident can sour an entire tribe against all foreigners.Finally, the people of Eleder are obsessed with dignity and decorum — going even beyond many northern countries in their attempts to prove that they’ve remained “civilized” — and consider the carousing of bored adventurers the height of impropriety. It is bad enough for dwarves to stagger through the streets singing after dark, but having one’s daughter indecently solicited by an Ulfen barbarian quickly alienates even the most open-minded Sargavan colonist.</p>

        <h3>Rosler's Coffer</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/map-roslers-coffer.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/map-roslers-coffer.jpg" alt="Map of Rosler's Coffer"></a>
        <p>Named for Ervin Roslar, a hero of the Shining Crusade, the town has survived over 800 years despite sharing a frontier with the orcs of Belkzen, even trading peacefully with several tribes who seasonally wander nearby. Lastwall considers the town, which helps establish the local borders and grows much of the flax used in Vigil, important enough to maintain a small garrison of knights there. While its existence has been challenging, Roslar's Coffer persisted largely without issue for centuries until the more violent Twisted Nail tribe pushed the less aggressive orc tribes out of the region and began launching raids against outlying farms. These attacks eventually escalated until the Twisted Nails assaulted Roslar's Coffer itself in 4707 ar, burning its historic buildings, wiping out over a quarter of the population, and scattering the remaining residents. About half the survivors returned the next season to rebuild, only to discover a territorial creature called a red reaver had moved into the Sarenite monastery a mile outside of town, forcing the church to relocate into the newly rebuilt town itself.</p>
        <p>Lastwall deployed additional knights to patrol the border regions as Roslar's Coffer rebuilt. These warriors turned back several new raids by the Twisted Nail, who eventually turned their frustrations inward toward Belkzen. None of the knights' efforts managed to dislodge the red reaver from its new lair, however. It continued to plunder nearby farms and assault travelers, and locals quickly learned to simply avoid the grounds and orchards once managed by the church and otherwise went on with their lives. Agents of the prestigious Pathfinder Society arrived last year to investigate the temple, and after a daring battle, finally felled the beast! The church of Sarenrae has made only brief surveys of the damage caused by the monster in its 10-year stay, and they still operate from town. This sudden burst of excitement nonetheless inspired many of the town's youth to spin fantasies about becoming adventurers and Pathfinders themselves.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Sarenite temple, Roslar's Coffer enjoys minor fame for Roslar's Tomb, a sizable crypt in the town cemetery that houses the earthly remains of several heroes from the Shining Crusade (although, ironically, not Roslar himself, after rumors of a scandal arose upon his death). Faithful of both Iomedae and Gorum occasionally visit on pilgrimage to pay their respects to these fallen heroes of the past, and the town is all too happy to provide accommodations in exchange for newcomers' coin. Thanks to its location along the Tourondel River, the town also sees some traffic in the form of crusaders, messengers, pilgrims, and traders from both Lastwall and Nirmathas.</p>

        <h3>Sargava at a Glance</h3>
        <a href="/serpents/images/map-sargava.jpg"><img src="/serpents/images/map-sargava.jpg" alt="Sargave Territory Map"></a>
        <p>Beset by devil-binding pilgrims and inescapable debts to pirate lords, as well as generations of resentment from the nation’s subjugated indigenous peoples, the colony of Sargava remains a bastion of northern culture and civilization in the heart of the southern wilds. Once part of a vast and mighty empire long since fallen to dust, as evidenced by the crumbling ruins still lurking beneath the veneer of lush farmland and verdant jungle, Sargava’s rich landscape is home to fierce Mwangi natives and even fiercer predators of the deep jungle, as well as a dwindling population of northern colonials who seek to uphold their ideals of culture and breeding at all cost, straining against the tides of resentment that may soon sweep them into the sea and return the land to its original owners.</p>
        <p>Founded over 500 years ago by Prince Haliad I as part of Cheliax’s expansionist Everwar, Sargava stood as the jewel of the empire for centuries. But when Aroden died, the empire was thrown into chaos, and Sargava’s ruler backed the wrong house in the Chelish Civil War. House Thrune took control of Cheliax and sent a flotilla of warships to retake the colony that had supported their enemy in the bloody conflict. Grand Custodian Grallus anticipated the onslaught, however, and made a fateful alliance with the Free Captains of the Shackles. Swooping out of Desperation Bay to pounce on the unsuspecting Chelish Navy, the pirates’ superior fleet swiftly ended the threat to their southern neighbor, and extracted a mighty price from Sargava for their efforts. To this day, vast portions of Sargava’s wealth flow into the Free Captains’ coffers for past assistance and assurance of continued naval protection.</p>
        <p>Financially weakened by the Free Captains’ high demands and cut off from many of their former trade partners to the north, Sargava faces an even larger threat from within. The native Mwangi people, inspired by the teachings of a mysterious, undead child-god in the nearby city-state of Mzali, move ever closer to open rebellion to free themselves from colonial rule. While Cheliax no longer has an official stake in Sargava’s government, the colonial Sargavan minority maintains control of the vastly larger native population. But the natives know that they have the resources of the entire Mwangi Expanse at their backs, and that Grand Custodian Utilinus’s government is in a poor position to quell a rebellion.</p>
