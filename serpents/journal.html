      <h2>Session Logs</h2>
      <ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Session 01 - Washed Ashore</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="/serpents/images/monster-dimorphodon.jpg" alt="Dimorphodon"></li>
        <li style="display: none;">The survivors had reached the wreckage of the <i>Jenivere</i>, precariously wedged on the rocks in the low tide. They noted how the water line was below their knees, but likely wouldn’t remain so low once the tide came in. They used a rope and a grappling hook to easily scale the large rock the ship was wrecked on and rappel safely down onto the top deck, where the full scale of the disaster became apparent – the entire lower deck of the ship and its hull were shorn off, as was the prow, leaving only the rear and upper half of the <i>Jenivere</i> intact. They also found the remains of the ship’s only longboat, tied up to the side of the ship and smashed to bits, evidence that someone used it to return to the wreckage before the tide went out.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Searching the wreckage, they started in the captain’s cabin. A large hole in the side of the ship allowed most of its contents to spill out to sea, but a large desk was wedged in the hole, keeping it and a footlocker from stumbling out. They recovered the footlocker, some supplies, sea charts, and the captain’s log, before smashing open a locked drawer and gathering up the captain’s emergency supplies – a bottle of fine brandy and a mess of potions. Some of the bottles were broken, including a miniature of the <i>Jenivere</i>, but with the water rising fast, they took what they could gather and searched below deck.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The middeck was most familiar to the survivors, as it was where they slept and ate while aboard. The lower decks were for the crew and cargo and were completely lost. The survivors killed a eurypterid that was scratching at the supply room before opening it to discover enough supplies to build out a campsite, along with the body of the first mate, Alton Devers. He had a series of older stab wounds from a rapier along with some fresher inflamed stings and signs of succumbing to poison. They hauled his body to the top deck and tasked Ishirou with shuttling everything they found to shore before the tide came back in. A thorough search of the larder also revealed the body of the ship’s cook, Rambar Terillo, who had been stuffed into a hidden nook, along with a small bag of salt that seemed to have been laced with something. Examining the body, the ship’s cook appeared to have been killed by a snake bite from a rather large snake. Finally reaching the passenger quarters, they stripped the beds of their blankets before exploring the animal hold, where Astra’s tiger was chained up and was eating the carcass of Ivy’s horse. Ishirou expertly calmed the tiger and convinced it to follow them back to the others, where Astra, Ivy, and Gellik were setting up camp.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Back at camp, they released Jask from his bindings and returned to him his armor, holy symbol, and spell component pouch that had been in the footlocker. Gellik poured through the captain’s log and sea maps, and came to an alarming discovery – it appeared the captain had gone mad and became obsessed with one of the other passengers, the Varisian scholar Ieana, and intentionally wrecked the <i>Jenivere</i> on the infamous island of <i>Smuggler’s Shiv</i>. Disheartened, several members of the group fell into despair, and everyone tried their best to get a good night’s sleep. That night, Astra and Loric shared a nightmare where they were retching over the side of the ship along with all the passengers and crew. With soup spoons in their hands, the captain ordered them to bail the ship out with their spoons.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The next day, leaving a few of the survivors behind at the camp, a scouting party set out to explore the beach to the west, planning to walk the coastline before walking back to the camp. They found the wreck of another ship, the <i>Tatooed Lady</i>, which had enough supplies aboard to build another campsite – a grim sign regarding the fate of the crew – but nothing else of value. They attempted to mark its location before continuing their journey, where they spotted an odd grey island covered in fungal stalks across the cove. As they worked their way around the point, they were attacked by several groups of dimorphodon’s as they cleared out their nests, with each member of the group taking injuries and several struggling with the effects of the dimorphodon’s poison. Returning with eggs for food, they made their way back to camp, only for several monkeys to steal and smash some of their recovered food stores. Astra had spent the day working with Jask and communicating slowly. As he opened up, he disclosed that he was from Sargava, and he had reported some corruption he uncovered regarding some civil servants and the Free Pirates of the Shackles. To his horror, his supervisor accused him of the crimes he had exposed, and he fled to Cheliax where he’d been in hiding for a few years before he was caught by a Sargavan official and extradited for trial. He wondered aloud if the wreckage of a ship known as <i>The Brine Demon</i> could be found here on <i>Smuggler’s Shiv</i>, as it reportedly wrecked on this island. It would be a long shot, but the captain of that ship, Avret Kinkarian, was one of the Free Pirates his supervisor associated with, and if he kept any records aboard, it might be sufficient to prove his innocence.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="clearfix" style="list-style-type: none;"><b>Session 01 - Washed Ashore</b>
        <li style="display: none;"><img src="/serpents/images/hero-souls-for-smugglers-shiv.jpg" alt="Attacked on the Beach"></li>
        <li style="display: none;">After over 100 days at sea, the <i>Jenivere</i> had taken on more than a few passengers to Eleder, the capital city of Sargava within the fabled Mwangi Expanse. The <i>Jenivere</i> is a large Wyvern-class merchant ship, a blue-water vessel making the same voyage it has made dozens of times before. The trip was exotic, sailing around the endless hurricane of the Eye of Abendego and through the pirate-infested waters of the Shackles, but it only featured a middling amount of danger or prospects for profit. With nothing out of the ordinary, save for some of the passenger's unique predilections, the <i>Jenivere</i> got within only a few days of Eleder.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">The various passengers had already had plenty of time to get to know each other, with the newest one boarding over a month ago, and all persons sharing the same bunk-filled cabin. Some, such as the Elf maid Aerys, preferred to be left alone as much as possible; others, like the gnome ne'er-do-well Gelik, kept the silence at bay with a constant stream of conversation. An unusually high number of passengers spent their evenings on the main deck, weather permitting, watching the sky and dancing in the starlight. This was tolerated by Captain Kovack as worship to Desna - or Shimye-Magalla as some of them called it - which would hopefully curry her favor in safely reaching the destination, but he did not allow his crew to be distracted by their ceaseless antics.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">Joining the Ship's Cook for dinner, the passengers dined while the crew worked, eating the same watery fish soup Rambar Terillo prepared every night. "This has no spice!" Avarice grumbled in Polyglot for the third time today, knowing the cook could not understand. Many of them chattered in an overlapping mix of Common and Polyglot, grousing again over the food, but Rambar characteristically ignored them as they ate. Dakota continued to disagree with the general motion of the ship and the salt-less bouillabaisse, and went topside to wretch while Avarice muscled to keep the food down as the ship rocked violently as it cut across the currents.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">As sensations began creeping back in, first the feeling of searing sunlight and warm sand against bare skin, followed by a lapping wetness and the sound of gently breaking waves, Ivy awoke first as a sharp pain cut into her foot. She had been pinched by a eurypterid - a sort of lobster with a scorpion tail! Looking about, she found herself on a beach along with several other passengers. The <i>Jenivere</i> lay smashed and wedged on the rocks offshore, with the rear half jutting out of the surf, while a half-dozen eurypterids trawled the beach, feasting on the detritus of dead crew members. Drag marks and footprints lead from the sea to each of the bodies slumped on the beach and to a pile of gear just ashore, with footprints returning to the water each time.</li>
        <li style="display: none;">After squawking in panic, Ivy successfully alerted Avarice, who began fighting the eurypterids with his bare hands, while she about waking the others. Dakota found some sharp sticks to fight with, and Ishirou charged in with his family sword. They made short work of the overgrown lobsters with them all avoiding the eurypterids stings and the worst of their injuries being only a few scratches. Feeling sick to their stomachs, they were in various stages of shock and were utterly unable to remember anything that happened after dinner the night before. The prisoner Jask was among those on the shore, still bound in shackles, but Ivy couldn’t get much out of him other than the phrase "not again" in Polyglot. Ishirou suggested they try to reach the wreckage to salvage what they could before the tide came in, while Gellik instead urged the group to find shelter from the elements. Splitting up, a portion of the group went up the beach in search of a safe place to cross the rocks, when they found a sobbing Sasha. She embraced Dakota and sobbed while standing next to the body of a shark which was filled with jagged stab wounds from a pair of saw-toothed punching daggers, saying something about not wanting to kill anymore. Sending her back up the beach to the others, the rest of the survivors set themselves to trying to get back aboard the <i>Jenivere</i>.</li>
