    <h3><i>&nbsp;“The new recruits can often be found staring at the relics in awe, whispering the stories they've heard since they were children to one another. Holy, they call them—and make no mistake, they are holy, but not in the way that people wish it. Every one of these trinkets is a tombstone, a memorial to a war so brutal that the mere act of surviving it made you a hero. Every bloodstained scrap of iron that lies behind glass or locked in a safe is all that remains of thousands of soldiers who died in the mud so that a few lucky souls could be hailed as legends. People look at our relics and speak of courage and glory, but not a one of them was worth the price we paid in people. Can you imagine what we could have had, if they'd lived instead? The art, the progress, the families they would have made?”</i><br> — Jaqualine Cairr, Knight of Lastwall</h3>

        <img src="/serpents/images/psychopomp-umble-thoot.jpg" alt="Umble and Thoot">
        <p>One is a Vanth named Thoot, a looming skeletal humanoid with large wings and a metallic jackal mask for a head. Thoot doesn't speak, communicating with hand gestures and unsettling gazes. A Nosoi named Umble rides on Thoot's shoulder. Umble appears to be a black raven wearing a porcelain mask. Unlike Thoot, she is extremely chatty—even making up impressive-sounding words when she can't find the right one—and greets the PCs with self-interested excitement. </p>
        <p>Custodians over a small valley of the dead within the Boneyard, the people of Roslar's Coffer fall under their jurisdiction. While not well thought of by their supervisor, Mictena, they nevertheless attend to their duties to the best of their - admittedly limited - abilities with all the enthusiasm they can muster.</p>
        <p>While they do not understand the condition of the Survivors of Roslar's Coffer, they sympathize with their plight, and will do everything in their power to help them get home to the land of the living.</p>

        <h3>Lady's Mercy</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-ladys-mercy.jpg" alt="Lady's Mercy">
        <p>Boons of the Lady of Graves, these tokens are rarely given by Pharasma and only to those chosen in service of the boneyard. More often, these enter circulation after being plundered from her treasury with the thieves mistaking them for common coins, unaware of the curse they bring upon themselves for such theft.</p>
        <p>When taken by a creature, these coins bind to their souls, and can only be removed, sold, or traded with beings capable of engaging in the soul trade. If a creature ends their turn at 0hp or less but are not slain, they flip a coin. If heads, the coin takes effect, but if tails, the coin does not take effect in this instance. If a creature has multiple coins bound to their soul, only one coin is flipped per turn.</p>
        <p>When a coin takes effect, if the creature possessing the coin is worthy of it, they are immediately restored to 1hp. If they are unworthy, their body is consumed, as via <i>destruction</i>. After a coin is used, it crumbles to dust.</p>
        <p>Destruction: These coins can only be destroyed by using them, by the personal touch of the Lady of Grave's or one of her usher's, or by the destruction of the Boneyard itself.</p>

        <h3>Cloak of Passage</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-cloak-of-passage.jpg" alt="Cloak of Passage">
        <p>A Boon of Barzahk, the Passage, these patchwork traveling cloaks are worn by those who have walked the Dead Roads with the Usher of Mortal Souls.</p>
        <p>These cloaks grant the wearer a resistance bonus to saving throws as <i>Cloaks of Resistance</i>, with a bonus equal to 1 plus the creatures experience as decided by the GM (typically 1/5 HD, or advancing by 1 for every completed book in an adventure path) with a maximum bonus of +5</p>
        <p>These cloaks are soul-bonded magical items, vanishing when removed and manifesting when the soul-bonded creature moves at least 5 feet. This item may be freely selected by a character with the arcane bond or implements abilities, or a similar effects, without any of the associated costs of changing a bonded item. For the purposes of bonded armor, this item counts as light or unarmed armor with no armor bonus, armor check penalty, or maximum dexterity.</p>
        <p>When a creature wearing the <i>cloak of passage</i> is subjected to a magical effect that sends them to a random plane, they are always sent to the Dead Roads in the Boneyard. Similarly, when such a creature is subjected to a teleportation effect, they always arrive on a suitable surface, and never take damage from being shunted to an appropriate space, though this protection does not extend to other passengers of such spells.</p>
        <p>These cloaks may be worn by creatures while in a corporeal or incorporeal form, though they may not be worn by undead and provide no benefit to creatures who are neither alive nor dead. While wearing one of these cloaks, any effect that prevents incorporeal creatures from passing, through, such as a <i>ghost-gate</i> or <i>anti-magic field</i> also prevents the wearer from passing through unless they first remove the cloak.</p>
        <p>Destruction: This cloak crumbles to ash if the creature it is soul-bonded with becomes undead.</p>

    <h2>Relics and Legacy Magical Items</h2>
    <p>Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. Occupying a space somewhere between artifacts and magical items, relics are powered by Zeitgeist, using their storied history to enhance their powers, but as relics fade into obscurity and stories cease to be told, they wane in both power and potency. Typically, to restore a Relic to its full majesty, it must be used to accomplish a number of triumphs as stories are told of it anew. However, certain relics may be reawakened to its former glory by being used to fight the same evils they once faced by one who is worthy of it.</p>
    <p>The bearer does not need to know how to become worthy of a relic to reawaken it to its glory, but they always must be wielding the item when they accomplish its prescribed worthiness task. A reawakened relic only manifests its full glory to those who are worthy of it. Spellcraft may be used to identify the worthiness task in the same manner as determining an items curse (typically DC 25+CL).</p>

        <h3>Roslar's Armor (CL5)</h3>
        <h4>Worthy Heroes: Dante</h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-roslars-armor.jpg" alt="Roslar's Mithral Breastplate">
        <p>The personal armor of the heroic paladin Ervin Roslar, this mithral breastplate is emblazoned with a red-winged rapier, the symbol of Arazni. Tiny runes etched along the collar read "Faithfulness always to the Red Crusader."</p>
        <p>This mithral breastplate has no enhancement bonus and seemingly no magical properties, save that it still has a lingering magical aura. This armor counts as a holy symbol of Arazni for the purpose of acting as a divine focus, despite her changed portfolio.</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p> -->
        <p>Worthiness Task: To be worthy of this relic, you must slay an evil being who is considered a worthy foe (CR >= 1+lvl) with positive energy. You are not worthy of this relic if you orchestrate for another to defeat or capture such a being only for you to step in at the last moment to finish it off. You cease to be worthy of this relic if you willfully commit an evil act.</p>
        <p>Glory: The armor gains an enhancement bonus of +2 and the <i>undead defiant</i> special ability. It also provides the wearer the benefit of either the Extra Channel or the Extra Lay on Hands feat (but not both), so long as they meet the prerequisites. Once per day when the wearer is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, as an immediate action the wearer may expend one use of channel energy or lay on hands to heal themselves as though they used the ability, plus an additional 3d6 hit points. If this healing restores the wearer to 0 or more hit points, they do not fall and may continue to act.</p>

        <h3>Nine-Eves Key (CL9)</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-nine-eves-key.jpg" alt="Nine-Eves Key">
        <p>The Nine-Eaves key grants its bearer magical access to both doors and enchantments. This small iron key has the number 9 and a right triangle engraved upon it.</p>
        <p>While the Nine-Eaves key is held, the bearer can use <i>open/close at will</i>, but only to open, not to close, and they may use it as a mundane skeleton key, but only to unlock locks, not lock them. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can touch the Nine-Eaves key to a magic item. For the following 24 hours, all Use Magic Device skill checks to use or activate the touched magic item gain a +4 insight bonus.</p>
        <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: To be worthy of this relic, the bearer must have at least 9 skill ranks in 8 or more intelligence-based skills. These skills must be treated as intelligence based for the character for them to qualify, but they do not need to originally be intelligence based.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Glory: In addition to its existing powers, the bearer gains a +9 insight bonus on disable device checks to unlock locks and open doors only. Once per day, the bearer may also cast <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>knock</i>, and <i>identify</i>, and once per week the bearer may cast <i>analyze dweomer</i>.</p> -->

        <h3>Thoot's Reaper (CL5)</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-thoots-reaper.jpg" alt="Thoot's Reaper">
        <p>Every Vanth carries a distinctive adamantine scythe as both a weapon and a symbol of its duty. This particular scythe belongs to a oft-silent one named Thoot, though its powers are not fully manifest in those not in service to the boneyard.</p>
        <p>This Adamantine Scythe has no enhancement bonus and seemingly no magical properties, save that it still has a lingering magical aura. This weapon counts as a holy symbol of Pharasma for the purpose of acting as a divine focus.</p>
        <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: To be worthy of this relic, you must destroy an undead creature who is considered a worthy foe (CR >= 1+lvl) with a critical hit with this weapon. If the undead creature in question has the ability to rejuvenate, they must be laid permanently to rest. You are not worthy of this relic if the undead creature rejuvenates, was willing to be destroyed, or you organized its defeat by another's actions. You cease to be worthy of this relic if you cooperate with Sakhils, engage in the soul trade, knowingly allow the creation of an undead creature or allow an undead creature to rejuvenate when you otherwise could have prevented it, desecrate a corpse, rob a grave or tomb, or violate any of the other tenants of Pharasma.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Unworthy: A creature who is not some form of neutral or is undead cannot wield this weapon, always drops this weapon when attempting to hold it, and finds the weapon impossible to lift or manipulate in any way. A creature who is no longer worthy of this weapon experiences the same, until they seek atonement.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Glory: This weapon gains a +2 enhancement bonus and the <i>Lifesurge</i> special ability. As a free action, a worthy creature can summon this weapon from Thoot's personal demiplane or any other location and have it appear in its hands instantly, so long as its not being actively wielded by someone worthy of it. It can also be dismissed back to Thoot's demiplane as a free action. If destroyed, it reforms in Thoot's demiplane after 24 hours.</p> -->

        <h3>Grace of the Last Azlanti (CL13)</h3>
        <h4>Worthy Heroes: Dave</h4>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-grace-of-the-last-azlanti.jpg" alt="Grace of the Last Azlanti">
        <p>Tethered to a simple leather cord, this Elysian bronze pendant resembles the holy symbol of Aroden, save that it bears the likeness of a closed eye surrounded by a halo of precious gems. In addition to functioning as a holy symbol of Aroden, the <i>Grace of the Last Azlanti</i> is imbued with the very essence of the human spirit, granting it a relic reservoir of 1 point, which replenishes at the moment of dawn in Rosler's Coffer, regardless of where it is at the time.</p>
        <p>By speaking the command word, the wearer can spend one point from the relic reservoir to gain one of the following feats as a bonus feat for 1 hour: Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, or Skill Focus. If the wearer already has Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or Lightning Reflexes, they can instead gain the improved version of that feat.</p>
        <p>By expending one point of willpower, the wearer can regain her daily use of one of the improved feats listed.</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p> -->
        <p>Worthiness Task: To be worthy of this relic, you must accomplish an incredible deed with the express purpose of defending humanity from enslavement, harm, or a similar threat. For example, defeating a lieutenant of the Whispering serpents whose CR is equal to or greater than your level + 3 is an appropriate task. You are not worthy of this relic if you complete this task by orchestrating events that lead to this situation, as determined by the GM.</p>
        <p>Glory: The relic reservoir increases to 3 points. In addition, the wearer can select from more feats when using this ability, adding Expanded Arcana to the list as well as all feats with “Extra” in their name — such as Extra Channel, Extra Rage Power, Extra Rogue Talent, and so on — that list as a prerequisite a class feature the wearer has. When conveying the benefits of a feat with “Extra” in its name, the duration of the amulet's effect is only 10 minutes. You may not have more than one feat granted by this relic at a time. As a 1-minute action, the wearer can activate the amulet before the duration expires to replace the previously selected feat with another choice which normally has a duration of 1 hour. By expending 1 point of willpower, the wearer may restore a single point in the relic reservoir.</p>

        <h3>Silver Scimitar of Sarenrae (CL6)</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/unknown.png" alt="Silver Scimitar of Light">
        <p>The hilt of this <i>+1 mithral scimitar</i> is warm with a gritty texture, as if sprinkled with invisible grains of sand. Clearly a divine relic of Sarenrae, though it doesn't count as holy symbol, the blade's mirror-like polish makes all reflected in it look as though wreathed in a fiery halo, while the blade itself emits a clean white light, like a torch.</p>
        <p>Whenever you critically hit an opponent with this relic, the relic unleashes a burst of fire in either a 20-foot cone or a 10-foot radius centered on the target struck and emanating from the wielders square. This never harms the wielder, though all other creatures within this area take 1d10 points of fire damage.</p>
        <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: The wielder must brighten the world by filling the relic with 50 motes of light. The relic gains 1 mote of light for every undead creatures slain with the weapon, brightening a barely-perceptible amount each time. Undead creatures or haunts with the ability to rejuvenate, such as a ghost or vampire, do not count unless laid permanently to rest, though if the wielder meaningfully contributed towards laying them to rest permanently, the scimitar brightens perceptibly by gaining 5 motes of light. If the wielder knowingly allows undead to be created, the scimitar loses 10 motes of light for each one, even after recovering its glory.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Unworthy: A creature who is not some form of good cannot wield this weapon, always drops this weapon when attempting to hold it, and finds the weapon impossible to lift or manipulate in any way. A creature who commits an egregious evil act, as determined by the GM, is no longer worthy of this weapon and experiences the same, until they seek atonement.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Glory: The relic's enhancement bonus increases to +2 and it gains the <i>keen</i> special quality. The light emitted by the scimitar also increases to bright light with a radius of 20ft. Similarly, the burst of fire unleashed by this weapon transforms into a burst of brilliant light, increasing the burst area of effect to either a 40-foot cone or a 20-foot radius, and increasing its damage to 2d10. Half of this damage is treated as fire damage while the other half is treated as raw divine power which bypasses any resistances but does not affect good-aligned creatures. The ultraviolet light generated by this effect deals double damage of both energy types to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes as well as any creature with light sensitivity or to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural. Any undead otherwise destroyed by this effect who normally have the ability to rejuvenate unless destroyed by sunlight are instead laid permanently to rest.</p> -->

        <h3>Silver Symbol of Golden Light (CL13)</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-silver-symbol-of-golden-light.jpg" alt="Silver Symbol of Golden Light">
        <p>Taking up the neck slot, this holy symbol is always warm to the touch and radiates a soft, golden light, and whenever it strikes metal it rings out with the sound of a choir of angels.</p>
        <p>Despite being dedicated to Sarenrae, the <i>Silver Symbol of Golden Light</i> may be used as a divine focus for any worshipper of a good deity or a neutral deity who is in favor of healing or against undead. When used as a divine focus for a divine spell, this holy symbol emits a bright flash of light that heals its wearer a number of hit points equal to the spell’s level. Once per day, the bearer can activate the <i>Silver Symbol of Golden Light</i> to cast <i>breath of life</i>.</p>
        <p>Worthiness Task: Unknown</p>
        <!-- <p>Worthiness Task: The wielder must use <i>breath of life</i> or a similar effect to revive someone who was slain by a powerful servant of undeath (CR>=lvl+1). You are not considered worthy of this relic if you orchestrate the circumstances by which someone might be slain by a servant of undeath, or if the person you revive is later slain by the same creature or transformed into a servant of undeath themselves.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Unworthy: A creature who worships an evil deity, no deity, or a neutral deity who does not support healing or fight against undeath cannot activate can never be worthy of this relic and cannot use any of its powers. You cease to be worthy of this relic if you demand any form of payment for healing or reviving another creature or allow someone to make such demands on your behalf, or if you purposely withhold healing you could’ve safely provided from an ally or innocent who sincerely asks for it and later dies because you withheld your aid. If you cease to be worthy of this relic, you must seek atonement before you can use any of its powers or attempt to (re)kindle its glory.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>Glory: The <i>Silver Symbol of Golden Light</i> manifests its full flory in several ways. This holy relic now glows constantly as though enchanted by a continual flame. The wearer may now activate the <i>breath of life</i> ability of this relic as either a standard action or an immediate action. When activated as an immediate action on a creature in response to them being reduced to 0 or fewer hp, and they do not fall unconscious if this healing brings them above 0 hp. -->
        <!-- <br>If the wearer of this relic is a divine caster with the domain ability gains the Day subdomain as a bonus domain (or the healing domain if they already have the Sun domain or one of its subdomains). If they are a spontaneous divine caster, they may add any of the spells from the Day subdomain that they are able to cast to their list of spells known. -->
        <!-- <br>Finally, the  <i>Silver Symbol of Golden Light</i> gains a legendary reservoir of 2. Each point of this reservoir may be spent in one of two ways, first being in a legendary surge to add 1d6! to any saving throw roll of someone within 30 feet of the wearer who failed a saving throw, rolling again every time they roll a 6 up to a number of times equal to their mythic tier. The second way is to enhance the healing granted by the holy symbol when using it as a divine focus from a number of points equal to the spell level into 1d6 for all allies within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to the spell level. Multiple uses of this ability does not increase the amount healing done or the number of rounds remaining, but instead resets the number of rounds remaining to the new spell level. The wearer may spend their own mythic power in place of the item’s legendary reservoir.</p> -->

        <h3>The Hide of the Gorgon of Lastwall</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/gorgon-lastwall.jpg" alt="The Gorgon of Lastwall">
        <p>The Gorgon of Lastwall terrorized the countryside near modern-day Roslar's Coffer during the times of the Shinning Crusade. There were not enough resources available to dedicate troops to stopping the beast, so Roslar went searching for it. When they crossed paths, it charged Roslar, only to get its horns stuck in a tree. Roslar weathered the beasts foul breath and stabbed the beast through the heart between its metal-plated skin just as it broke free, slaying the beast and saving the poor farmers living nearby.</p>
        <p>The hide of this gorgon is massive and damaged, but useful for more than just a trophy. In it's current state, it counts as broken +1 Hide armor, though it has a total armor bonus of +7, a Maximum Dex bonus of +3, an armor check penalty of -6, and weighs 75lbs. If properly fit and repaired, it will provide a total armor bonus of +8, have the maximum dex bonus and armor check penalty of masterwork hide armor, and weigh 50lbs.</p>
        <p>Gorgon hide counts as a natural material for druid abilities, but otherwise counts as a metal. It also counts as heavy armor for the purposes of speed, though it only requires medium armor proficiency to wear. A creature wearing Gorgon Hide gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist being turned to stone or petrified. If a creature wearing Gorgon Armor has a breath weapon, once per day they may trade 3 uses of their breath weapon to breath a 60-ft. cone of Gorgon gas. Anyone caught in the cone must make a fortitude save with the same DC as their regular breath weapon, after which they can't use their breath weapon for 1d4+1 minutes. Gorgon Armor is always considered masterwork.</p>

        <h3>Crypt Rod</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-crypt-rod.jpg">
        <p>Candy-stripped like a barber pole, this rod was utilized by the Tooth Fairy Matriarch of the Palace of Teeth to find graves and tombs to plunder for the last organ to fade to time - teeth.</p>
        <p>This 3-foot-long iron rod has a flanged, conical head and strikes as a +1 light mace. On command when held in hand, the rod points in the direction of the closest grave, tomb, or cairn within 500 feet. If the wielder concentrates on a specific type or subtype of creature, the rod identifies only gravesites that hold the remains of that type of creature. The rod can search for the remains of a specific individual if the wielder carries an item that the individual owned in life.</p>

        <h3>Cryptstone Weapons</h3>
        <img src="/serpents/images/loot-cryptstone-weapon.jpg" alt="Cryptstone Weapons">
        <p>These odd-looking weapons were gifted to the Survivors of Roslar's Coffer by a psychopomp friend, carrying with them the otherworldly powers of the Boneyard.</p>
        <p>Cryptstone is a dense gray stone scavenged from the mausoleums of the Graveyard of Souls in the Boneyard. While cryptstone may appear ancient and pitted, the supernatural essence of the Boneyard has infused it with power over the eons. A weapon made of cryptstone grants a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against undead creatures; this damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Additionally, any nonmagical weapon made of cryptstone affects incorporeal undead as if it were a magic weapon, and weapons made of cryptstone that have the disruption special ability increase the DC of that ability by +1. </p>
