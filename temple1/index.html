    <p>Emblazoned on every Latter-day Saint temple are the words "Holiness to the Lord - The House of the Lord." When early Disciples first listened and then followed nearby the Lord, the scriptures record: "Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day..." (John 1:38-39). So it is with us, the Lord invites us all to come to His house, learn His ways and be His people.</p>

    <h2>Indianapolis Indiana Temple - Come and See</h2>
    <div class="news">
    <p>On 2 October, 2010 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced plans to build a new temple in Indianapolis. This was to be the first temple in Indiana.</p>
    <p><i>"We continue to build temples. This morning I am pleased to announce five additional temples for which sites are being acquired and which, in coming months and years, will be built in the following locations: Lisbon, Portugal; Indianapolis, Indiana; Urdaneta, Philippines; Hartford, Connecticut; and Tijuana, Mexico.</i></p>
    <p><i>"The ordinances performed in our temples are vital to our salvation and to the salvation of our deceased loved onces. May we continue faithful in attending the temples, which are being built closer and closer to our members." -President Thomas S. Monson (October 2010 General Conference)</i></p>
    <p>The Groundbreaking Ceremony was filled with the Spirit. On September 29th, 2012 more than 200 members, invited guests and media representatives gathered on the plot of land purchased by the church, nestled at the crossroads of Spring Mill Road and 116th street in Carmel Indiana; the selected site of the Indianapolis Indiana Temple.</p>
    <p>It had been just over 18 months since the Prophet, Thomas s. Monson, had announced the construction of the temple. The Groundbreaking was, in the words of Elder Donald L. Hallstrom, of the Presidency of the Seventy, a "journal entry day."</p>
    <p>Initial site plans and surveying of the grounds had already been started, and the day dawned sunny, brisk and clear. The program, which was presided over by Elder Hallstrom, included his wife Diane Hallstrom, Elder Gregory A. Schwitzer, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, and his wife Joann Schwitzer, Elder J. Christopher Lansing, Area Seventy and Indianapolis North Stake President Paul H. Sinclair.</p>
    <p>Opening the meeting, the congregation sang, "I Love to See the Temple." President P. Thomas Burdett of the Muncie Indiana Stake offered the invocation. The closing hymn, "On This Day of Joy and Gladness" was sung by a multi-stake choir. Sister Gail Cowley of the Indianapolis West Stake offered the benediction.</p>
    <p>The architect's framed rendering of the Indianapolis Temple was unveiled showing a beautiful, single-spired, cream-white temple. Ground was then officially broken directly under where the Celestial Room would be located. The ground was broken first by the presiding authorities and their spouses, then local priesthood leaders, community leaders and invited guests. Finally, anyone that wanted to take part in breaking the ground was invited to come and be a part of this historic event.</p>
